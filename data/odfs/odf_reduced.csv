It works, but has issues;"Really disappointed. I've been very satisfied with Aeon Labs mini motes, door sensor (if not a tad overpriced), and I especially love their smart energy plugs (the dongle stylle). So even though the first generation of their 4 in 1 received not so great reviews, I thought that perhaps the company would have read the same reviews and taken corrective action for the new model. This was wishful thinking on my part.

It took two attempts to pair up the device with my VeraEdge, including an exclude in-between. Once paired, I then had to go to the Vera forums to find some custom setting just to get the device working at all. The light intensity sensor doesn't seem to be giving me anything useful, but that could just as easily be the fault of the Vera. The temperature sensor consistently reads about 7F warmer than it actually is. At least it's consistent in error so I can work around it. The motion sensitivity is set with a tiny little rheostat style knob. While I can appreciate the infinite variable setting, it sure does take a lot to get it dialed in just how you want it; especially since there's no indication which direction is more or less sensitive. One positive characteristic is that you can supply continuous power with a standard USB cable. Where and how you'd manage to mount this with a ready USB cable is a bit of a mystery to me, but nevertheless it's a nice option to have.

Lastly, I got this unit the same week that I also got a Fibaro 3 in 1 motion sensor. The Aeon Labs must be about double the size, maybe more, of the Fibaro. Discreet is not an adjective I would ever attribute to the Aeon Labs and the mounting solution for the Fibaro is both simple and genius. This one bulky, stiff and generally a PITA. If Aeon Labs had priced this more competitively, say around the cost of an Ecolink motion sensor, I'd have no problems bumping up the rating to 3 stars for sure. Not four because even at the same price as the Ecolink, it doesn't perform as well as the Ecolink. If you need more than a motion sensor, I'd say it's worth the couple extra bucks for the Fibaro. If all you're really looking for is motion sensing, I don't think you can beat Ecolinks. Either way I wouldn't recommend this sensor. You can do better elsewhere. Well I guess there's always the next release which is probably quite a ways off.";3;1

Even highly compressed stuff that I've recorded off the TV on a DVD-R recorder looks a lot cleaner, played back on this unit.

My DVD-R unit burned out, so after reading lots of reviews I bought this Samsung. I read reviews of older, similar Samsungs and saw that they were region-hackable. About 50% of my DVD collection was purchased in the UK and the other half in the USA after I moved here. Region-hackable is therefore a necessity for me. As of yet, nobody on the Tinternet has posted a region hack for the USA model of this player. Grrrr! I took a gamble, and it didn't pay off.

I am not an advocate of ripping off copyrighted material but this region encoding thing is a pain in the butt. Movies seem to get released to all regions almost concurrently nowadays so why can't they just disband this silly, crippling, big brother idea? (rhetorical question - don't flame me please). I will now have to buy an el cheapo, non-upconverting DVD player from Wal*Mart to play my region 2 movies on - they're always hackable.

That's the only bad thing about this player. Good points are:

* Very minimalist. No flashy chrome or bright lights to distract the eye
* Very small. Less deep than any other player I've owned
* Remote is compatible with Samsung TV remotes
* Doesn't get hot at all, even after being left on all day
* Remembers DVD resume point over a (front panel) power-off event
* Relatively quick to start up and load a DVD
* Slide show from USB socket is useable and ""hi-def"". Haven't tested that extensively

Not-so-good points are:

* Because it's so lightweight, kids pushing the buttons repeatedly push it further and further back into the TV furniture
* Vacuum fluorescent display is very dim. Unreadable from a distance at daytime
* Menu rendering is a bit cheesy. Very low res menu screens.
* Can't seem to have ""raw"" digital audio out of the SPDIF connector and decoded data from the HDMI socket concurrently. One menu setting affects both sockets. I can't remember the exact terminology from the menu but if I set it so that my Yamaha HT receiver can understand the audio data stream, the TV can't (and vice-versa).
* Saw it in Wal*Mart for 5 bucks cheaper than Amazon, the day after I bought it. D'oh!";5;2

Since I bought this unit about a month ago I guess I'm lucky I got one while they last, though I am only modestly impressed with the unit. The remote is unintuitive and unrefined, while the onscreen menu options are limited. It does not contain a tuner, and depending on your cable and television can be a bit cumbersome to set up. Most annoyingly since it contains no tuner of its own, it has no Type F coaxial (screw in) connection on the back, which is a grievous oversight.

The unit is adequate for dubbing VHS to DVD, and in all candor I have few complaints about the DVD portion of the unit, but the VHS side of the house leaves a lot to be desired: obviously VHS source material generally looks horrible by today's standards, but the actual operation of the VHS deck is extremely clunky and the rewind function is exceptionally slow. This unit pales in every way in comparison to my beloved Panasonic DMR-EZ48V from about ten years ago. It finally gave up the ghost, and boy do I miss its versatility, logic, and DVD mastering controls. This is a relatively inexpensive unit and for bare bones VHS to DVD transfer it is adequate, though it's not outstanding at anything.

Unfortunately there are few options available to consumers who want VHS to DVD dubbing capability in one unit or simply want DVD recording capability (which I personally prefer to the limited storage available and lack of transferability inherent with DVRs), so if you want a VHS-DVD recorder, get it while you can.";2;2

After seeing an earlier view about what the Russian word for ""language"" looks like, it was easy to change the menu over to English.  After that, instalation was easy.  The wide angle view on the forward looking cameral ensures that vehicles overtaking you on either side can be seen and increases the likelihood of recording an incident that occurs outside of front and center.  However, it also makes everything appear small, so it is not possible to read license plates.  Since the camera records sound, you can overcome this by simply reading out loud the license plate number of any vehicle that raises your suspicions.
Initially, the camera would turn itself off when it stopped sensing motion.  It would then turn itself back on when I started moving again.  The turning on process takes about five seconds.  I was concerned, as I believe the first five seconds after starting through an intersection is probably one of the most likely times to get hit by someone running a red light.  I went to the menu and turned the motion sensor off.  Now it not only records whenever it has power, it also keeps the display on the whole time.
The memory card is tiny, and my fingers are big and clumsy, but I can still get it in and out without much ado.  To be honest, when I first got the camera, I was pulling the card out and viewing the recordings on my computer.  But after a while of wathching uneventful trips I had just made, I stopped.  Now I figure, that I'll only pull the card out if there was an incident, so the inconvenience of trying to get it out of the top of the camera is not really much of a factor.
I gave this camera four stars because it records video very well and sound pretty well and does everything I want it to.  (The application that uses googlemaps to track your trip is pretty cool as well).  All of these features for ~$80 is pretty impressive.  If I decide to get another for our other car, I'll get another one of these.";3;3

I have the receiver linked to my home automation system.  When motion occurs on the transmitter, it sends a signal to the receiver relay outputs, and the relay outputs trigger events in my home automation system, such as turning on lights.  What made me purchase this product over competitors is having relay outputs on the RF station and flexibility in configuration with the jumpers.  For example, by adjusting jumper 4, one can change the time the relay outputs last -- 1 second, 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes.  On the transmitter, jumpers can adjust whether the LED flashes, the measurement range, and various other settings.

This setup works well most of the time.  However, the motion sensors don't trigger 100% of the time.  Every now and then I'll walk directly through the motion sensor path, and nothing happens.  I know the Dakota Alert is the weak point and not my home automation equipment because the red LED on the transmitters does not go off when the motion sensors fail to trigger.  In contrast every time the red LED goes on, the setup works as expected.  Other motion sensors I've used trigger 100%, so this type of failure does not occur with certain competitors.  This difference may relate to the Dakota motion sensor only triggering on a narrow line, while competitors triggering on >90 degree range, which gives far more opportunities to try again after a missed event.  Similarly if you want to trigger on cars that pass through the motion sensor for longer periods instead of people, then you might not have a problem.

My other complaint is not having a setting to re-trigger until the full countdown has expired.  For example, if the motion sensor is triggered every 5-9 minutes and the relay out jumper is set to last 10 minutes, then I'd expect the relay to out to never go off since it is getting re-triggered before the 10 minutes are up.  Instead the receiver counts 10 minutes from the first trigger, then turns off, ignoring all re-triggers that occur in that 10 minute period.  With all the configuration options, I'm surprised, there isn't one to support re-triggers.

I suppose most users don't care about the relay outputs and trigger on cars instead of people, so the Dakota Alert might be exactly what you are looking for, even though it wasn't for me.";2;2

It was barely usable with Lollipop because it was just extremely buggy and Google was extremely slow about updates. It ran hot, crashed a lot and the battery life was pretty pathetic in general even after a Factory reset. Marshmallow brought a lot of relief, with huge improvements to battery life and stability, but it's still not 100%.

This tablet is not something I would ever classify as a flagship device worthy of being classified as a competitor to the iPad.  I've had two HTC devices with Nvidia processors (this tablet and the HTC One X+). I'm not impressed with either as the high performance promised by Nvidia on paper just doesn't shine through. These chipsets are buggy battery hogs as far as I can tell. I also have the Nexus 6 by Motorola based on a Qualcomm chipset and it is a dream, especially compared to this tablet. (As a side note, the Nexus 6 is the best phone I've ever owned by a wiiiide margin.)

I really like Marshmallow, but I still think Google is optimizing it for smartphones. Tablet support in general is just an afterthought. Even though this device now gets regular updates since Google started doing monthly security updates, they seem to cause problems with the Nexus 9. After the last update, it crashed so frequently that I was on the verge of a Factory reset. Manually wiping out the cache partition through recovery addresses some of the instability. I don't see the same issue on my Nexus 6, so I am again left with the impression that this device is just an afterthought for Google.

If you are considering this tablet, don't bother unless you catch it on a fantastic sale. It's not worth the price.";3;1

2) The first point is not *that* big deal, except the build in level is *utter rubbish*.  Don't trust it at all -- get a proper level and use it.  Otherwise your TV will be askew and there won't be anything you can do about it.

I have to unplug and then replug the Lexar in order for my system to recognize it and the little blue light on the Plugable to go on. I tried the Lexar in several different USB3 ports on the Plugable, but it behaves the same way. I plugged the Lexar card reader directly into one of the computer's USB3 ports and the device turns on after boot, so it's something to do with the Plugable. As this is just a minor inconvenience, I'll keep the Plugable unit.;4;3

but the thing that i wasn't expecting that also happened with the purchase was an appreciable increase in performance.  first off, my data rate showed an increase of better than 25% with the new unit.  then, to top it off, the error rate of the data stream which caused my old modem to periodically drop data streams, improved to such an extent that this disturbing occurrence went from 2-3 times a week with the rental unit to once in the 7 months that i have owned the new box.
in sum, i can't recommend the purchase of the motorola surfboard sb5101u cable modem highly enough, especially if you are someone like myself who has no other choice of internet connection other than comcast cable company.";6;4

This digital camera allows FULL control of picture capture - apeture size, speed (1/800th sec!), film speed, a white balance differential, manual zoom, and basically everything you have in an SLR and more.  The pictures are excellent on the auto setting for outdoor shots. Indoor shots are more difficult, but can be done well with some steady hands and setting customization.  Close up shots are limited to greater than 7-8 inches.  However, there is a macro option allowing the range finder to know you are focusing up close.  The flash can bleach out images, but I've been using the white balance to correct this easily. From a straight forward image quality and ease of picture taking, I cannot complain.
The LCD screen is fabulously clear.  The interface does take some time to understand, but is no more difficult than a computer monitor interface.  The read/write can lag if you really push it with semi-auto like shooting or using repeated multi shot.  The zoom is not bad, but has something to be desired with the tube extension making the proportions not quite a true point-shoot camera or an SLR.
+Bonus
There are some nifty and useful functions like a 3-spot light meter that gives you the average, a 360 panorama stitching function, 5-shot `autowinder,' and video recording capability. The tactile feel is excellent with a non-slip surface on the hnad-interaction areas.
+Connectivity
No card reader needed with the included USB patch cable.  Super simple and a very fast download time.  Using XP makes it even easier - don't even need the 3rd party software.
+Longevity
With a 128 MB card at 1600x1200 resolution (medium) I can burn through the card 1-2 times with downloads no problem, dependent on the flash and LCD use.  This is a lot of shooting on 4 AA NimH - from my past Kodak and Nikon dig cam experience.
Peeves include no immediate delete option when you've just taken a bad picture. And you can record audio to a picture, but can't playback on the unit until cpu download.  I could continue with the lame 16 MB card included and one-time use batteries, but the overall verdict is that Olympus made a very professional camera for people who want total control but the convenience of semi point-shoot size dimensions.  5 stars for rock-solid performance at a fair price.";4;4

Other then the letters C, N, M, L, and > completely disappearing from the keys, the keyboard functions flawlessly.

The only real problem for me is that I make much more typos using this keyboard than my Thinkpad.  For whatever reason, this keyboard feels cramped than the Thinkpad keyboard even though they are very similar in size.  Yes, I measured the keyboard.  Maybe it's the shorter space bar, but I've learned to live with it.

The other complaint is the feel of the keys as compared to a Thinkpad.  The keys feel ""cheap' with no tactile or ""click"" response.  Rather you get this mushy ""plasticky"" feedback that lets you know that you are banging on a cheap keyboard.  It could be worse, but nothing you couldn't get used to especially if you've never used a Thinkpad keyboard.

This was the only choice for a compact keyboard when I made my purchase, but now shopping for a different model.

There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.

The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.

There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.

If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.

The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get ""some"" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.

IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?

The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?

I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated.";1;0

They have exceptional clarity for their size. I spotted a deer over a mile away and could tell he was a spike while glassing. When properly set, they are as good as my Prostaff 7s binos.  They weigh 3/4 pound.  When wearing glass on your neck all day, saving a pound or more makes a huge difference. I hardly notice them. The same cannot be said for my Prostaffs.

As far as negatives, I found a few minor ones. They lack a mount for a tripod adapter.  This is not a big deal by itself, most users of these glasses won't even care. If you plan to glass all day, you probably won't use these binoculars. But if you want an ultralight bino for this purpose and need a mount, look elsewhere. Otherwise, plan on trying your best to hold these steady for long periods of time. They are light and comfortable to hold. But holding such lightweight optics makes them subject to shake. Since they are 8x25mm, the exit pupil is narrow and further complicates the shake issue. Lastly, the eye piece extends for eye relief but tends to retract back. This is more than a minor annoyance for the spot and stalk hunter.  When retracted, the ocular lens fogs badly in cold weather when placed against a warm sweaty face.  This is less of a problem with the eye pice extended for relief.  It costs the hunter critical time to defog and adjust the eye piece.  The eye piece should hold its position and require deliberate rotation to retract.

So these little glasses are excellent but not very forgiving. If you can take the time to adjust and don't need to run and gun, they're perfect. If you are a fast paced hunter, they work but you might get frustrated with them. I

All in all, these are fantastic for the price. If you need a lightweight optic that won't break your neck or the bank, I can see no better option on the market. Despite a few criticisms, I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again or recommend them to a friend looking to shed some weight from his glass.";3;3

It's as if it was never tested during the design process.  Here are the many problems:

- Handle tends to fold on itself rather than stay in the 90 degree postion.

- Handle is so close to the ground, or the wall (if mounting on a wall), that you will scrape your knuckles when winding unless you are careful and hold the handle with your finger ends(stupid, stupid, stupid design).

- They supply two mounting brackets so that you can mount it to a wall or other place.  But, it really must have four brackets for smooth operation.  If mounted on a wall, the entire reel tends to come out of the brackets, especially when you have most of the cord rolled out.  Very, very annoying.  This could have been easily solved by making the channels on the brackets a little longer.  Like I said, stupid design.  You can buy extra mounting brackets for $5.00 by mail.

- The carrying handle on the top of the reel is hollow, so two very thin plastic edges cut into your fingers making it very uncomfortable to carry when you have 100 feet of heavy 12 guage cord.  This is also really dumb and could have been easily avoided in the design.

- If you want to use it on the floor, you really should mount it to a board not only because of the above mentioned knuckle scraping, but because it will assist in holding the reel in place.  Again, could have been solved easily in the design.

I still give 3 stars because it works and most of the problems can be solved if you are willing to work with it.";3;2

At a retailer selling price of $130, it provides the ability to wear day and night and features activity analysis, sleep monitoring, an LCD display, and a 7-day rechargeable battery. Without further ado, let me dive into the specifics.

Feature Overview:
Captures all-day activity including steps, distance and calories burned
Tracks workouts with real time distance, pace, calories burned and total time
Wirelessly syncs to your iOS or Android Smartphone via free app for easy viewing
Monitors sleep levels throughout the night and assesses quality
Displays text alerts and incoming calls directly on your wrist
Convenient Phone Finder allows you to track down a missing phone
Goal alerts  set up goals in the app and be congratulated when you achieve them
Temperature and weather alerts
7-day Rechargeable Li-Ion battery

Easy of Use:
The Timex Move x20 is very easy to use on the tracker itself. There only two buttons: Home which toggles between the Clock, Workout, Sleep, and Find modes; Scroll/Select which toggles through Steps, Distance, Calories, Date, Weather, and activates the modes.

However, if you want to view activity details, you will need to use the app which is not intuitive and does not show very valuable information. Also, every time you want to view your activity data, you have to manually sync the app to the tracker. While this does save some of your phones battery, the lack of background syncing means it takes several seconds (about 15-30) each time you want to view your data.

The Problem:
While the tracker looks really awesome on paper, there are some really big problems with the Timex Move x20.

- The Fit -
The fit of the device is really bad compared to something like the Fitbit Flex. The top half of the tracker is molded plastic and has no give or flexibility. If you have a larger ulnar styloid process, the Move x20 can cause wrist pain. For example, I am about six feet tall, and have relatively small wrists. I bought the Medium/Large (the largest size Timex makes) and the molded plastic sits moderately uncomfortably on my wrist.

- Construction Quality -
Looking online, you would never notice the LCD flaw on every physical device. That is probably because what you see in Timexs product advertisements do not accurately reflect the device. Notice the red circled section of my Move x20. When I bought the tracker, I immediately thought the display was cracked. I contacted Timexs customer service with pictures, and they said that is how all the Move x20s look and that what I am seeing is the edge of the LCD display. In my opinion, this is just poor build quality. If Timex didn't agree that this is a flaw in the design, they would have removed it from their product images.

Along the same lines of quality, I would be very scared to wear my Move x20 in the shower. The user manual states Your Timex Ironman Move x20 is resistant to water splashes (you can wash your hands or get caught in the rain, but you don't want to submerge the device). Water splashes?? Just how much water splashing is okay?

App Integration:
With most trackers like Fitbit, Garmin, and Jawbone devices, they have pretty rich app integration. Many food and exercise apps will use data from your tracker to provide you with more information and make better calorie burning calculations. The Move x20 has no third-party app integration. For that matter, they do not even provide their users with a web interface to view more detailed data. And, as stated before, their own app provides very little detail or benefit.

Summary:
You might be asking why I even gave the Move x20 2 out of 5 stars. Well, the fact is, when completely isolated from a smartphone (after initial setup), the tracker is pretty easy to use for very basic functions. Also, the battery life is very good considering it has a display of more that a couple dots.

As a final note, I would not recommend this product, at the retail price, for anyone that is interested in an activity tracker. The Move x20 is not horrible, but the poor construction quality, limited app functionality, and price of the Timex Ironman Move x20 make it a no-go in my book.

I've ended up purchasing an amplifying splitter instead to boost the signal loss that comes with long cable runs, since two of my rooms were having trouble with signal attenuation.

I was looking for a wireless headset/mic combo. I had come from the Turtle Beach x31's on XBOX and straight to these.

Pros:
Wireless (duh)
Detachable mic
Nice cable
Nice battery life
Loud
Colors can change (if that's your thing)
The software that comes with it
Plug and play (better sound if you install the software)
Seem to be made well

Cons:
Ear cups get uncomfortable after about 2 hours
Virtual surround sound, not physical
Battery dying beep is annoying
Top band gets uncomfortable after about 3 hours

Conclusion:
I would probably not buy these again, but they serve my purposes well enough and I rarely ever play long enough for them to be uncomfortable. Don't like the virtual surround sound as much as I thought I would, not their fault, mine for not doing more research.";4;2

Key differentiator here is that it's an Archos and can thus play a variety of video formats right out of the box: eg: divx, xvid, etc.

HDMI out, 1 ghz dual core, 2 USB ports, 3g stick capable, built in kick stand (this has proven to be very useful).

pros:
-honeycomb 3.2
-beautiful screen
-ports
-good battery life
-nice archos native apps
-kickstand
-can play divx and xvid out of the box!
-pay like 10-15 for an archos plugin that plays AC3 audio (does any tablet anywhere play this audio format???)

cons:
-doesnt have the build quality feel of an ipad or galaxy (doesnt have their price tags either)
-has locked up on me a few times, but nothing a reset cant handle
-very difficult to find accessories (I did a custom cut Invisible Shield skin-like installation on it)
-sometimes HDMI out freezes

the only thing i'm not sure of is whether ice cream sandwich will get ported on this thing... i really don't feel like rooting it.

Update: Archos has confirmed that this will be updated to Ice Cream Sandwich making this one of the most future proof tablets on the market.

Update2: I've now played with this for awhile as well as a Asus Transformer (not Prime) and an HTC Evo View (gingerbread, 7in, same as HTC Flyer), as well as an IPAD2.  I have to say, dollar for dollar this thing stands up to the field. Transformer and IPAD2 blew me away (but i think that's just the sheer size and the resolution). The HTC Evo View was surprising spry with the 7inch size, but the ratio was not optimal for movies.

In terms of the archos:
-8in is not perfect for eBook reading in bed (but perfect for the coffee table with the kickstand).
-512 ram is not enough. But, i can't decide if it's the TI processor or the ram or simply Honeycomb. Bottom line is that sometimes i feel like i need to defrag this thing so i reboot it (and that works). I cant say definitively what is causing the lag and delays, b/c this is Unix based with Java apps vs Windows. So, I'm not technical enough to understand the garbage collection and RAM management. Just reboot this thing everyday or so, and you should be fine :)
-tested the USB port below with my verizon 3g stick and cant get it to work
-was however, able to power all my external drives with it! including a 2.5 5400 with no power supply (trick is to reboot with drive plugged in)
-tested the HDMI out... Awesome but sensitive, if u move around too much and it loosens, signal will freeze (this could also be due to cable quality)
-USB charger is standard so i can charge it with my various cell phone chargers (in the car, with random USB chargers strewn thru my house)
-Flash on honeycomb has been fun as it allows me to play some flash based games. But set your expectations: this is a 1ghz machine running 512 ram. Flash can be a hog and thus, don't expect the same performance as your 2ghz duo core laptop.

All in all, i still love this thing. I recommend it for your starter tablet or the one u throw in your bag and hit the coffeeshop with.  However, after feeling the build quality of some of the others, I'm now definitely getting the Asus Transformer Prime (upgradeable RAM!?).";1;3

The wifi range seems to be better compared to the X6, getting full bars on wireless devices that were previously not at full strength at the corners of the house.  Setup is similar to previous routers in the past, pretty straight forward without any issues using the Genie UI.  Overall a great upgrade for the money, to me it was a better value relative to the X10 due to the useless (in my case) AD band.;2;4

Unable to decide between the top-rated Toshiba NB205 and the equally applauded Samsung N310, we stayed true to our centrist leanings: we bought both, $300 each on sale. The reviews by other customers cover well the strengths and the weaknesses of these netbooks. The unknown with any product is customer service. Here, the netbook god Atom gave us an opportunity to test Toshiba and Samsung equally, as each unit's Bluetooth was giving us agita. This is what happened. When I called Toshiba, the customer service representative not only walked me through possible solutions, but quickly realizing that I had tried most of these, escalated the issue to a ""level 2"" technician. When our call disconnected, she called me right back and stayed on the line until the technician could speak with me. The technician quickly sent me an e-mail link to gain remote access to my netbook and then walked me through what he was doing. Bluetooth problem solved. Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. Here is customer service that lives up to the name. Compare that with Samsung. Until we got rid of the N310, the Bluetooth would not transmit sound to a headset. I was sure the solution was simple: perhaps a new driver, perhaps a pairing step I was missing. Both Samsung representatives I spoke with were nice but at a loss. The first promised to call me back after he investigated but never did. The other rep, aware of the failure to call me back, also promised to call me back after testing his own Bluetooth settings, this time within one hour. You guessed it: no callback. By this time, I had plenty of time to explore both netbooks. The Toshiba NB205 with Windows 7 Starter kept impressing with its serious build quality, its fantastic keyboard and bright display. Just turning it on is a pleasure. Everything about the NB205 is serious, yet intuitive. The Samsung with Windows XP was, by comparison, always efficient but an aesthetic letdown. Despite its unique rubberized exterior and anti-bacterial keys (a big point in getting it for the kids), overall it always felt unbearably plasticky. Not Acer-cheap, but still, no contest when compared side-by-side with the NB205. Bottom line: not impressed. Even the kids liked the more solid feel of the Toshiba. Me, I'm just completely impressed with the total Toshiba experience. So I gave the kids the NB205 and am waiting for the Pine Trail Toshiba NB305 to come online, perhaps the Qualcomm Gobi-equipped 3G model. Meanwhile, Samsung, I'm still waiting.";5;2

Pros - Super high quality build heavy gauge steel
- Awesome access.  open the door and you can get to the back side of everything with ease.
-Adjustable rack rails accommodate the new square bolt rack nuts or standard rack screws both are included.

CON - I can't believe I actually have to write this:(  The unit is too shallow for most common rack mount equipment without buying special cords.  I had to instal a 24 port gigabit switch into this box with a standard power cord that ships with the unit and standard cat 6 cables the cables get munched on back and front if you close the door an extra 1.5 inches and it wouldn't be an issue.

Knock outs for cords in and out would have been nice also.  The have a removable panel but its huge 3""x 7""  so I had to drill a hole and install a desk wire grommet to keep things tidy.

I had to buy 90 degree up and down cat 6 cables and a 90 degree left power cable so my switch will fit.  I got a work around so ultimately its fine but its really poor planning on the manufactures part they should have known that this unit might need to accommodate standard corporate switches and similar gear with the same foot print.  Most high end switches have the same exterior dimensions.  Wonder if they ever tried mounting anything in it;)";9;2

Well, this is why.  I was about to buy this unit when I read Mr. Samuel M. Livingston's very knowledgeable review below where he discusses the fact that all antenna's such as this one are horizontally directional, meaning they work best in the plane perpendicular to the direction the antenna is pointing.

Well, my router is in the basement and ALL the computers that use it are on floors above it. Hmmmmm.  You know, I had always wondered why my Linksys router had antennas mounted on highly articulated joints that allow them to rotate in any direction.

I went down to my basement and pushed the antennas down so they were parallel to the floor instead of parallel to the wall.  POOF!  Every computer in my house gained an additional bar of reception.  I didn't need a high-gain antenna kit any more.

I was pleased with it when it arrived as it fit perfectly and looked great.
Then I realized the black keys on the Kuzy were completely opaque. No light from the letters came through no matter how high I cranked the keyboard backlight. Light spilled around the keys but the letters were not visible without ambient light.
Then this week the cover began buckling up in the middle - like it is swelling where I touch it most frequently. See the uploaded photo.
Since we use covers to keep our MacBook Pros safe from accidental spills this buckling pretty much makes it useless. I will be replacing the Kuzy with a Moshi shortly.";5;1

You can probably go for Jaybirds or Beats for better sound, but if you're working out (and I mean really working out, not standing around checking your phone at the gym) do you really need perfect bass response, balanced sound, yada yada? Not saying that these headphones are bad by any means, they're actually really good, but the nominal difference and improvements are not worth the price increase. Especially if you're like me and throw things around in your gym bag afterwards.

To me, the sound is really good on these headphones, and I use Beats Studio Wireless every day at work as a comparison. Bass, of course, could be better but it's such a compact package that it's a reasonable trade off.

The battery life is great! It'll last me at least 3-4 days before having to charge, given about an hour at the gym daily. The charging port is micro-USB so it's convenient if you have an Android phone or other device that uses micro-USB - you won't need to carry around a second charger.

The cord is tangle-free as it's wider and not stringy like, say, the apple wired headphones that come with iPhones. Also, it has volume up/down and play/pause button that works with a Samsung Galaxy S6, Moto X, and Nexus 5X just fine. Only thing is that I wished it had a clip in the back of the cord to clip onto my shirt - my old pair of Sony Ericsson HBH-IS800 had that it was convenient when I had to remove one or both of the ear buds so that it doesn't slip off to one side.";5;4

The best screen protectors include the liquid that you spray on it, that helps smooth out bubbles, which boxwave does not include.

While it seems strong enough to hold a full size DSLR along with a mid sized zoom, like the 24-105 F/4.0 L, that camera and lens combination (about 3 pounds) really pulls on the strap if you just let the camera and lens dangle from your wrist.  For that reason I think the wrist strap is best for a slightly lighter combination, like a DSLR and a small prime lens.  It works fime when I attach a 50mm F/1.8 Mk I to my camera - about 2 pounds.

One additional selling point.  Because it uses the same OP/Tech fasteners as a number of other OP/Tech products, I can detach the wrist strap and use the fastener and attach to it my full size OP/Tech USA Pro Strap.  Very interchangeable.";2;3

the only problems I see on it is that the LCD display, even when it's big and have good resolution, has a problem showing the real colors and brightness of the image, you it will take you a good time to learn how your real picture will look based on the one on the LCD. I have been taking pictures with all of the options of the camera and I still couldn't learn which one to choose. the other problem is that it's really hard to focus on close objects, even faces or solid objects.

However, two sets of issues have presented sufficient frustration that I don't think I will ever again buy a Dell product.
The first to appear is the huge amount of preloaded software, some of which is very difficult to get rid of.  Central in annoyance is the row of huge tiles across the center of the screen for quick access to all the stuff I will never ever use, totally blocks the screen until you find the little ""x"" to get rid of it until next time. I probably spent 3 hours figuring out how to make it go away permanently.
I don't know if it's Dell or the new version of windows, but it is all but impossible to get rid of those silly useless little logo tiles - and again it took several hours even to figure out how to control them.  Documentation is seriously crappy, and there is no support.
I use a wireless transmitter so I can listen to Pandora, as well as to the music I have stored on my hard drive and play them on my stereo in the other room.  Almost every time I want to use the transmitter for Pandora, I have to configure the machine to send the signal out through the wireless instead of to the built in speakers (which are tinny, good for nothing beyond talking on Skype).  Again - documentation is crappy; the little pictures on the devices menu say it is hooked up and running, and it takes an hour or longer to figure out how to get it to work.  Often I have to play something through RealPlayer (which for some reason does go to the transmitter) - then I turn off RealPlayer and, like magic, Pandora comes out of the living room speakers.  But next time I turn it on, it's through the tinny little built-ins again and I have to go through the whole routine all over again.
I bought a wireless printer with the package.  Same problem - the cute little pictures say it is ""ready"" but when I print the job goes to a file, not to the printer.  Every time I want to print something, it takes an hour or longer to figure out how to get the printer to work - I often have to go through the entire setup again.
I've had this machine for over a month, have wasted probably 20 hours trying to iron out the bugs, and it still isn't working right, and Dell offers absolutely no support.
The menu of little pictures they have in place of the former detailed system menu is worthless.  Very few options, almost none of what you need in order to get rid of the cutesy crap and clutter or make the peripherals work.
Great engineering, terrible software and interfaces, almost no documentation, help menu worthless, and far too much pre-loaded junk. This is the 4th Dell machine I've bought - and the last.";5;1

I would definitely buy these again now that I know how to put it on well.

Tips for buyers:
1) Try to be in a dust-free environment.
2) Keep the sticky side of the sheet DOWN (dust FALLS more than it RISES).
3) Start at one edge and try to go across left to right or right to left in a straight line, not diagonal.  Diagonal didn't work for me.
4) Keep pressure on the middle of the sheet as you apply it.
5) Go slow and steady and try to remove bubbles immediately as you apply it so you don't need to lift it off again (which can end in disaster).

Now that it's on, though, I highly recommend these.  The price is great for the nice quality of these protectors.";3;3

No regrets at all!!! If you are looking for a honest design, good sound quality (and mainly volume) in a very small speaker without spending a lot of money, this is the one!

The size is close to a dollar bill.

Nice feature. there's a line output in the speaker, which means you can use it as an bluetooth receiver. When I have parties at home I connect it in the AUX of my sound system and it works as an bluetooth receiver. VERY VERY VERY nice feature!";5;4

One of the reasons for doing that was that the phone had expandable storage as compared to the other model of device that I had. That fact led me to this card.

I should note that I work in IT, have a fleet of microSD cards and am the type of person that will usually work through a bug without problems. However, the card's bugs were ultimately not able to be worked through.

On a computer if I plug the card in, it will read and write just fine. On any device it will lock up the camera, cause it to fail, and eventually I have to reboot the devices. It won't let me read songs off of it, nor will it allow me to read other misc files. I tested with another phone, and even with the USB port in my car and they wouldn't read.

I cleared the card, formatted twice and the same behavior occurs. If it wasn't for the fact that it's a $30 card this would be in the return pile. As it is I do not find it worth my time, effort and shipping to return it. I'll throw it in an adapter and use it as a USB drive, but I would not encourage people to buy this particular card.

Overall I'm disappointed as I have had zero problems with 2 other 16GB class 10 cards that I've bought with the ADATA name on them.";3;1

I really wanted a mic/volume control capable headset since I would use it to adjust volume/skip tracks. My first purchase was just a knockoff of the real thing - the headphone was made of cheap plastic and the wires just felt plasticky. Went to the trash in less than 5 minutes. So after some more searching I came across this headphones. The video review seemed nice as well as most of the other reviews. After almost half a year or using it, I've decided that it's one of the worst headphone purchases I've made, slightly better than the previous knock off headphones.

Pros:
Has headset control (Play/Pause button)
Cord is sturdy and doesn't tangle easily
Looks pretty slick

Cons:
Hurts my ears while working out because of non-ergonomic design (rubs against my outer ear)
Doesn't fit my right ear as well as the left, causing decreased sound performance
Sound quality is about as good as any low tier $10 headphone
No volume controls (WTF moment for me)

Other thoughts: I should have never trusted the video by that old geezer. He obviously is no audiophile, doesn't use the headphones for anything similar to how I use it, and probably doesn't buy tech products. The low price should have been an alarm, but I've been buying 20-30 dollar headphones all the time, since they serve as a my workout headphones, while I use my more expensive, better headphones at home and other places.";3;1

It's constructed sturdily with a hard plastic shell that's got a very thin foam liner that should both cushion and reduce slippage.

1)  The fit.  I've worked this thing for close to a 1/2 hour trying to get the back clasp into position so it will fully close.  It's nearly there, but I can't fully get it done.  I don't want to break my iPod, and I'm having to put some pretty significant force into this without positive results.  Interestingly enough, it's tight enough, it's probably not going to fall off spontaneously.  I'll update this post if it does.

2)  The button cut-outs are so deep, it's difficult to access the controls.  The top power button and side volume buttons are the worst.  This decreases the ease of the iPod's functionality.  This may be a result of the overall poor fit of the unit, but I don't think so.  The millimeters that are off on the case's fit won't fix the problem of the buttons' cutouts.  It does not dock well on my nightstand alarm clock with the case in place.

I would recommend you look elsewhere for a case.  Spend a little more to protect that couple-hundred bucks you're holding in your hand.

Immediately upon receiving them, I realized I had made a mistake.

As motorheads like to say, there's no substitute for cubic inches. When it comes to audio, there's no substitute for surface area. This type of in-ear phone uses a diaphragm that's only a couple of millimeters across, whereas earbuds like Apple's are about a centimeter across, and that makes a huge difference. These sound very tinny and irritating in the mid- to high frequencies; an A/B test with Apple earbuds and Phillips sport earbuds ($10 on the same order) was like night and day. These simply can't touch the even frequency response, bass presence and smoother treble of earbuds, even older-generation ones from Apple.

While I would never expect audiophile quality from something this small (and cheap!), I had hoped for much more.";2;1

My only previous experience with GPS is renting a Garmin 330 with a rental car twice. My wife hated the Garmin, I liked it, but I was awe struck by the tecno-factor. So we went looking on-line to see what was available. We bought this unit specifically because it met my wife's criteria. She loved that it spoke street names and not just ""turn right"", ""turn left"". She also like that it was loaded with the AAA data. We have been AAA members for more than 35 years, so this feature appealed to us. If you are not a AAA member, then any GPS that has POI's is probably satisfactory for you. She also demanded one feature - she hates highways and wanted something that would provide the shortest distance without using highways. This was the only unit that did that as part of a standard routine. For everyone else it was either not possible or required extensive navigation to get to the screens where you could program it to use that criteria.

My experiences thus far have been luke warm. When picking ""shortest distance"", it doesn't always pick the shortest distance, even though it was programmed with the roads that were shorter than the map it gave me. On the other hand, it went to some extremes that were not reasonable to get the shortest distance such as having me take an expressway off-ramp and on-ramp because they went in a straight line while staying on the expressway made a curve around the exit area that probably added 100 feet to the trip. It also had me taking miniature turns in small towns, also just to save a few feet. All in all, the shortest route was very hard on driving and gas and not always right. To make matters worse, the unit out of the box would crash constantly when you picked the ""shortest"" route. All other options worked fine. I went online and got five software updates and the crashing problem disappeared. However, the newest maps for this unit are the 3rd quarter of 2006, so there are a lot of things not on there. We missed several streets in Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Southern California because they were not yet programmed into the GPS even though the streets were at least a year old.

The unit also suffers from overly menu-driven programming. Things should be remembered from time-to-time so you can just reuse frequent data. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't - at least not intuitively. For example, when you program your ""home"", it takes eight different menus to select it as the place you want to go. Just to add it to the database took several minutes of typing in information. I assumed I could park in my driveway, click on something that said ""add current location"", give it a name and be done. That doesn't happen. When you are searching by categories and such, it doesn't have a paging menu. If ten items are listed and you want to scroll, you have to do it one item at a time; for example, you type in Columbus because you want to go to Columbus Ohio. You get 12 hits, Columbus, Ohio being number 9 on page two since they won't all fit on one screen, and you have to down arrow nine times to get to it. I would have liked to hit next page and down arrow once or twice to get to it. These may sound petty, but when you are programming and driving this is a distraction (and I don't necessarily mean programming while moving, just pulling over and taking this kind of time is annoying).

Finally, I am sending the unit back because the hardware is defective. The clip (called the cradle) that attaches the GPS to the holder doesn't fit the unit. It just keeps falling off. All the experience you have read above came from having the unit sit on my lap while I tried it out.

It also gives odd changes and distances from point-to-point. This is just an opinion because it isn't wrong, but let's say you are going twenty miles on an expressway before you get off. The unit doesn't say you are going twenty miles. It says you are going six mile, then seven miles, then seven miles. Each distance is when you cross a major highway or a county line. It is not relevant information for any reason I can grasp. It knows where I am going and should just count down for me.

My last comment is a feature recommendation that should be considered. The trip computer is very limited in the information it provides. When I used the garmin, I could touch one button and a thing popped up that looked like an automotive dashboard that told me speed, ETA, miles to go, miles traveled, all sorts of good data about what happened, what is happening and what is yet to happen. It was very thorough, including top speed this trip, average speed, time stopped, etc. The trip computer on this unit says average speed, distance, elapsed time and that's about it - plus it takes four menus to get to the info - again, not useful if you want to track when and where you are going and how your progress is doing.

I gave it a three because after the software fixes, it will get you where you want to go, but it is not worth the differential we paid between it and the newer versions from Garmin. Again, that's a judgment call on my part, but I used the 320 and 330 and they now have the 350 and 360, or if you want the 650, 660 and 670 whose feature set is greatly expanded from the one I first experienced.

All in all, unless you are really tied to user simplicity, I wouldn't recommend this unit.";5;2

first one.  Each Logitech set tends to be 'best of breed' in their time and the MX-5500 Revolution is definitely one of the best configurations currently on the market.  I purchased this to use on a new system and was recently using the MX-5000 on my work and home computers so some of my comments will reflect comparisons to the MX-5000.  Also, be aware that I am a self-proclaimed 'keyboard junkie' and use a ton of keyboard shortcuts to limit the time I go to the mouse so I can work a little faster so some comments may not apply as much if you are a heavy `mouser'.  Simply put, I like the setup and even with some of the cons I note I think it is really nice and worth the money.

*** PROS ***

The display text is a little larger and a little better angle than the MX-5000 was.  That said, less info shows on the display so you have to scroll between settings to see additional info.  For example if you want to go from the temperature to see the time or the current track playing you have to press a button below the display to do so.  I like the display though and think the increased visibility is a nice change from the MX-5000.

This was very easy to setup.  The keyboard and mouse work just fine by doing nothing more than connecting the dongle to a USB port though you don't get some of the more advanced features without installing Set Point.  As always, do not install the Set Point software that comes with the combo - go to the support link at [...] and download the latest version.  Each version of Set Point has added features and stability over the previous versions which was very important with the MX-5000.  I downloaded version 4.60 (shipped with 4.26) and it updated the Bluetooth dongle firmware without any interaction during the installation. I was not prompted for a reboot when the install completed and I found the keyboard a little flaky until I reboot the computer.  After the reboot everything worked perfectly.

I love that Logitech got away from the touch system on the MX-5000 for media controls and used real keys.  For volume, mute, track and play/pause it is much better to have 'real' keys instead of the touch variations on the MX-5000.

The entire system works very cleanly with almost no lag.  This is a combination of the new bluetooth dongle and the enhancements in recent versions of Set Point.  With a recent version of Set Point the MX-5000 had almost no lag, but it seems that the MX-5500 is even better.

This system is highly configurable.  That said, you will see some issues in the CONS section with regards to configurability.  Despite those issues, this is by far the most configurable combo setup from Logitech.  I love changing the thumb scroll wheel to control volume (push is mute) and being able to change the main scroll wheel to click or fast spin per application is great.  Even with the default setup this is nicely configured and I think most folks will really like the options.

The one touch search is a fairly nifty feature as well.  Basically you highlight a word or phrase, aim the mouse at it and press the button below the scroll wheel to kick off an Internet search.  It defaults to Yahoo search, but you can change it to Google, AOL or live pretty easily.

*** CONS ***

No power switch on the keyboard.  Many of the previous cordless keyboards from Logitech included this feature.  No matter how power efficient the keyboard is, it drains the battery faster turned on than if you shut it off at night, on weekends, etc.  You can always remove the batteries, but that is not very realistic on a regular basis.  Without a power switch the keyboard should `hibernate' or go into some other power saving mode after being unused for a period of time.

The power cable is permanently attached to the mouse cradle.  The previous versions had a cable that plugged into the cradle which made running the wire through desks or around obstacles a little easier.  I found it a bit annoying trying to run the power cord so it was fairly hidden as the wall plug was on one side and the cradle the other and neither part easily fit through the cable cutouts in the desk.

I have found that the keyboard is not responsive before booting into Windows.  This can be an issue if you need to boot into safe mode, modify the BIOS, etc.  If you get this set, make sure to keep an old wired keyboard handy just in case you ever need it.  Actually, it is not a bad idea to keep an old corded keyboard and mouse with any wireless set as it seems that the batteries only go out when you don't have spares.

The Windows right-click button (AKA ""App Menu"") is missing and replaced with a Logitech FN key (this key is typically found between CTRL and ALT to the right of the space bar).  You can access this feature by pressing the FN+PRINT SCREEN or SHIFT+F10.  Multiple keys are definitely more hassle than it is worth for most keyboard junkies.  It would be nice if the FN key could be remapped as a right-click key, but that is not possible per Logitech.

Using the main scroll wheel to scroll side to side is a bit tough.  Many higher end mouses include the ability to `push' the wheel to scroll left and right.  This works, but I have to move my hand around on the mouse to do it.  Folks with different hand shapes may not have this issue and it is not the most commonly used mouse feature anyway.  This is likely not a huge negative unless you just love doing this type of scrolling.

The sleep button above number pad can be a problem.  While this button is more out of the way than many of their previous keyboards, it is still fairly easy to hit it if you do a lot of 10 key work.  All it takes is one 'fat finger' moment and you have put the computer to sleep.  For some less savvy computer users they will have a `what is happening' panic moment that could be fairly stressful even though they likely won't lose anything.  It would be optimal if you could remap this key or disable the feature, but that is not possible currently.

The missing NUM LOCK key is just plain annoying.  This has been discussed by a number of people so I will not harp on it here.  The number pad is enabled by default and you do have arrows in the middle of the keyboard, but for gaming and some other applications is it nice to turn on the navigation keys on the number pad.  Not a huge issue for me, but something to consider if this is a deal breaker for you.

There is no USB extension cable for the bluetooth dongle as came with previous versions.  I often didn't use the USB extension cable, but it was handy for some desks where the monitor, keyboard and mouse are fairly distant from the actual computer.  An extension cord is easily available and it may be just as easy to have a small USB hub for convenience if you really have connection issues.  I was able to use the keyboard and mouse much further away from the dongle than with the MX-5000 so I don't think this will be much of an issue and the increased distance is likely why the cord is no longer included.

I miss the scroll up/down buttons above/below the scroll wheel in the MX-5000.  That was pretty handy when scrolling through a large document.  These buttons helped when reading something lengthy so I didn't burn out my index finger scrolling a lot.  I think it would have been tough to include these buttons with the design of the Revolution mouse, so I can understand why they are no longer there but I still miss them.

The inability to change the one-click search to a different engine than Google, Yahoo, AOL or Live is a bummer.  If you love a different search engine, this really restricts you.  Since most folks probably use one of these engines it is likely not a huge issue.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was a 'tweak' to change this, but geek tweaking is probably more hassle than it is worth for most.

*** LOVE IT OR HATE IT ***

Mouse scroll wheel switches between hyper spin and click spin.  I have enjoyed this feature and it is great that you can configure it to click spin a little slower in a program like your browser, but do a faster free spin in programs like Word or Acrobat where you have a lot of info to scroll through.  I can see this being something some folks may get annoyed with though.

The Revolution mouse is definitely a love it or hate it.  It is a different feel and the scroll wheel where you thumb rests takes a little getting used to.  I have grown to like the mouse, but you may want to stop by a local retailer that sells mouses or combo sets so you can be sure the feel works for you.";3;3

The Dynatron K987 model appealed to me because it has basically the same form factor, but is overall much higher quality.

Pros:
-Metal mounting screws and springs with a backplate for solid and easy installation.
-Taller cooling fins.
-Copper core.
-Quiet fan.

Cons:
-You will have to remove the motherboard to attach the backplate, at least for the 775 type socket install.  If you're already comfortable replacing the CPU fan, this should not be too big of a deal for you.

If you need to replace the stock CPU cooler that Intel provided with their Core Duo CPUs and need a similar form factor, this is an excellent upgrade.";4;4

It works, but poorly made.

Pros: looks good, connectors are solid and works well (after modification - see below)

Cons: HDMI connector is poorly connected to the wall plate

I am currently renovating my basement and in doing so, I've decided to hide all of the wires within the walls.  I've decided to use clean wall outlets for everything: audio, video and networking.  For the Video, I wanted to hide the HDMI cable and looked for HDMI/coax wall plates.  Most of them are in the $15-30 range.  This was the cheapest model.  I figured that I would go with this model.

When the shipment arrived, I noticed that the HDMI connector wasn't attached to the wall plate.  I figured, ""oh, I have to attach it myself before installation.  No problem.""  However, when I opened the package, I noticed several plastic pieces floating in the bag.  I realized then that the HDMI connector was already attached to the plate, but it had broken off.  In fact, the connection is so miniscule, I wondered how anything would withstand a jossle or two.  The connector is plastic (molded into the plate) while the screw is metal.  The HDMI connector is pretty beefy, so its weight alone probably put a lot of stress on the connector.  I had to make some modifications (I used longer screws and screwed from the outside face of the plate) to make it work.  It's pretty strong now, but not as pretty (exposed screw heads ruin the ""clean"" look).  In fact, even if they didn't break upon arrival, I feel that they would have broken if you connected your cable to it and pushed in with enough pressure.  Suggestion to manufacturer: either beef up the connectors or don't even connect the HDMI cable to the plate - ship it loose.

Overall, it works and is functional.  However, it is poorly made and you will definitely need to modify the connection to the HDMI connector in order to ensure long lasting performance.  Other than that, if you are willing to spend more money, I'd look at one of the other HDMI wall plates.";4;1

The device arrived in a solidly foamed packaging to protect the component inside, always a plus.  The unit allows for control of 4 separate fans and has leads for 4 temperature sensors and affords a good performance for cost ratio.

Pros: Cost and unobtrusive LED read outs, they're clearly visible without casting a obnoxious level of ambient lighting, the readout is fine and clear.  The dials are smooth and you can use subtle pressure to fine tune the speeds you wish to spin your fans at.  The temp readings are fairly accurate, I tested a number of different locations in my case using additional sensors from a hand held device and they were typically within 2 C.  The unit comes with 6 temp probes, a definite bonus because the probes are delicate and break easily in a moment of carelessness.  I test mounted it in 3 very different cases, in each instance, the unit fit into a standard 5 1/4"" bay with no issue.  Finally the unit is fairly straightforward and easy to install, even without a manual, you could figure this things operation and configuration out through average deductive reasoning.

Cons:  Wires.  Lots of them.  Tiny placement pins for fan wires and temp probes.  I imagine its a necessary evil, since one is going to be powering 4 different fans with this unit, and each fan has its own control, but it makes for a lot of wire management.  Fitting the fan wires to the control unit requires a delicate touch, the plastic housings are small and all along the right hand edge of the unit's inner wall.  The right mounting plate butts right up against the connector pins, so if you have thick fingers, have a pair of tech tweezers handy or you'll be cussing up a storm.  Likewise, the printing on the back of the unit does tell you what pin is what...but in text so tiny that you WILL need a magnifying glass and they are not intuitively placed as far as their numbering goes. I was quite surprised that the numbering of the temp probes was actually backwards from what I expected them to be.  Finally the mounting plates on both side of the unit are short, though you can screw them into most cases without too much issue, the plates are short enough that if you were to accidentally nudge the unit it would tip down no matter how much torque you put to the screws.  I think the mounting plates should have been longer for more stability, but I imagine that's part of its cost management.

Conclusion: I'm happy with the product, it does pretty much exactly what I wanted, spinning 4 fans at user controlled speeds and with a reasonably accurate temp reading to go with it.  Its a simple and reasonably elegant solution for the need I had, the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is summed up in the Con section.  I have no hesitation recommending this to someone as straightforward solution for one's fan needs, although I would like I said, strongly recommend a magnifying glass and a set of tech tweezers to spare you a good deal of frustration.";3;3

I wanted one 16-port unit instead as there are downsides chaining 2 8-port switches. The downsides to chaining 2 8-port switches include losing 2 ports for the chain, as well as the inefficiency in routing/switching when the route goes through the link cable that links the 2 switches. The total speed between ALL the computers on one 8-port switch and ALL the computers on the other 8-port switch is limited to the speed of the link cable (the cable that links the 2 switches) - so this can seriously affect communication speed if more then one computer on one switch is talking to computers on the other switch. Not a big deal for some, but I prefer not having that limitation.

I like the light display and the build quality with the metal case. I like the fact that it suppose to be power efficient. It certainly seems to be running cool.

There's no fan so its completely silent. The power supply is in the unit, and it is plugged in with a standard computer power cable.

I got it at a great price, so as long as it works solidly, which it has so far, the value is currently unbeatable.

I'll update this review should I encounter any problems.

UPDATE 2013-05-08: I haven't had the switch all that long, but so far not a single issue, and don't expect to have any problems.

After using this Garmin for a little over two weeks, I must say that this is as good as advertised. That being said, here are my pro's and con's on the nuvi 765T

Pro's

excellent overall design and build quality, far better than the competition

screens are bright with great resolution, very intuitive and easy to navigate

excellent update times on the mapping screens

mounting hardware, though lightweight plastic, is sturdy and reliable

NAVTEQ mapping software seems to be incredibly accurate, recognizes what road you are driving on from country lanes to interstates and everything in-between

routing engine for navigating seems to be very accurate most of the time, the route the GPS calculates is always the shortest distance

traffic information feature is excellent and very useful

other features such as lane assist and 3-D rendering are very nice

Con's

have not been able to load 2010 mapping update to the GPS

bluetooth feature does not work with LG cell phone

advertisements are necessary evil that comes with traffic feature though the pop-ups do not block mapping screens

Overall, a very nice high-end GPS from Garmin and an excellent choice for anyone in the market for a GPS device with some extra features";2;3

In a pinch.;"""Leather finish"" is some marketing major's way of saying that the plastic case is textured instead of smooth, but let's call it what it is -- cheap plastic.  The ""leather finish"" snap-on back and the iPad just sort of sit into a slot in the keyboard tray.  The ""adjustable angles"" mean that there is a piece of plastic behind the iPad in the base that pushes the iPad forward or backward.  The iPad isn't secured into the base/keyboard at all.  If someone walks by and knocks the table, the iPad falls right out.  If you put this on your lap, a little tilt and the iPad tips right out of the keyboard.  There is this inherently unsafe feeling in the entire setup because, well, the screen is just not connected to the keyboard at all -- you are relying upon gravity to keep everything in place.  To ""close"" this keyboard, you remove the iPad and then try (and the operative word here is ""try"") to close it all up tightly.  I say ""try"" because I have witnessed (a) keys being knocked off and (b) incomplete closures, resulting in the entire contraption falling apart unexpectedly.  With the price of iPads, this is a solution that seems only acceptable on a table or a desk and, even then, only if you can get past the shortcomings of the keyboard itself.  I've used the similarly-designed NT38B Airbender case by New Trent.  It overcomes the insecure feeling of this keyboard, but the keyboard is similarly flawed.  There is a ""sleep"" button where touch typist expect the backspace key, the keyboard itself feels cheaply made (keys literally fall off if you aren't careful) and, perhaps not entirely the fault of the design, it is uncomfortably cramped (a concession to the small size of the iPad).  If you are seriously considering this keyboard, go with the Airbender instead -- while more costly, the added security of a unified solution is worth the price.";3;1

You can easily watch the below celestial objects
-> Moon in a very high definition
-> Mars
-> Jupiter with jupiter's moons
-> Saturn
-> Venus
-> Orion Nebula
and many many objects.

Pros:
-> Very helpfull viewfinder
-> The First light software is very helpful
-> Sturdy design
-> The 90degree prism makes erect images
-> Very nice focal length

Cons:
-> Tripod is very very bad. The movement of the telescope up and down while tracking will be of a big challenge
The horizontal rotation is fine. But when u move up and down while u r watching through the eyepiece, it will become very difficult to track due to the spillover movement in the tripod's rotators. WHen u tight your telescope, it gets tight in a different position. With this tripod, it almost becomes impossible to tight the telescope exactly after tracking something. You fix it and the telescope will move and gets fixed somewhere where u can see only blank sky. For such a company like celestron, this tripod is a black mark.

-> Heavy vibration on the tripods. The nuts and bolts and joints starts sounding unusually after some days of usage.
If you plan to buy this, better buy it along with vibration suppression pads or else it will not be fruitful in long term

From a telescope perspective, this is a very nice investment for a beginer to intermediate astronomers. You will enjoy the fun of it when you see it in refractors.

My suggestion to celestron is to fix these tripods to avoid frustration on these nice telescopes. The goodwill of telescope is lost because of the bad quality tripod.

Overall, this is a product I am enjoying every day. Please be very choosy between reflectors and refractors. And please don't see sun using this. Even with a solar filter, i suggest NO. Refractors get in a lot of light focus which sometimes makes the UV rays even come out of solar filters.

Nice product except for the Irritating Tripod. :)";3;4

Almost every app out there uses the back camera, making that one a severely crippled device. I am not sure why these reviews are lumped in with the reviews for the 16GB devices as these are 2 completely different devices. You will also lose access to a very large portion of the app store's catalog as some apps will not even start if they don't detect that a camera is there.

I have had this device since launch and its good. I bought it brand new in a sealed package, not like some other reviewers that seem to have gotten a used device. But the battery life is absolutely terrible. It is very hard to use this device when the battery dies so fast. The problem with the battery is the meter is just not accurate, it will show full at some point, then when you go to take a picture or use an app, the battery will tank to half capacity. Then it goes back up after you quit the app. Why not have the battery meter go down gradually? There is also no battery percentage number like there is with the iPhone so you never know exactly how much battery you have left. The point here is that you could have approx. 70% battery, go to use an app and take one picture, then the battery goes down to 30%, then if you press the power button to turn off the screen it might go back to 60% capacity. The battery also cannot be changed by the user so this cannot be fixed. This device could be so much more useful if it had a better battery included. There are other devices similar to this out there that have longer lasting batteries, for the price of this device I just expect a longer lasting battery, not only in terms of how much use I can get in a day without charging or seeing a low battery warning but in terms of how many years I can get out of the battery before its completely shot. I only use apple approved chargers and not fake ones either so that is not the problem.

Also I have had 2 of these devices, a 4th gen and a 5th gen, and I have had the same battery problems on both especially after one year of use. These devices should last more than 1-2 years before the battery gets down to a 1-2 hour life span. It also seems to happen after the 1 year warranty expires and apple won't replace a device for low or sporadic battery life. I have not had problems with batteries on other devices, like Nintendo handhelds, and I play those a lot more than I do on the iPod touch. I have Nintendo handhelds that have their original batteries and are more than 5 years old and the battery still charges and lasts almost like new and these devices have been used regularly if not more than I use the touch. Nintendo batteries go down gradually and do not rebound falsely in capacity. Plus these devices also have batteries that can be replaced if you order a replacement from Nintendo online for about fifteen dollars. If you are buying the iPod touch you can count on having to pay one of those mall services to change your battery for $80-100 or buying a new device altogether after 1-2 years since your battery will be shot.

If you are gaming on the device, count on maybe 1-2 hours of life if that, you might only get an hour. Plan to charge every hour if you are just playing games on it because games will drain the battery like no tomorrow. Therefore this device probably wouldn't be good for long periods where you will be not near an outlet to charge. This device probably wouldn't be good for kids on a road trip or flight unless you have some source of power nearby especially if they are playing battery draining games.

Why am I making such a big deal about battery life? If the device doesn't have adequate battery life, it cannot be powered and therefore becomes an expensive paperweight a lot faster than it should. I should not have to take special steps to reduce usage just to extend my battery life, I bought the device to use, not to limit myself to only certain features or to disable certain features to extend battery life.";3;3

I bought a 50"" Panasonic Viera Plasma TV many years ago.  Consumer Reports listed Panasonic Viera TVs as the very best.  It was expensive as they hadn't been out for very long.

I did research again and this line came out on top again.  I also checked the reviews, etc. on amazon.  I am totally amazed at the picture quality, ease of set up, design, features, etc.  The picture is amazing.  Brilliant whites, very black blacks and all colors are brilliant.  I doubt I will ever get over the picture quality.

The set up is very simple and I completed everything in less than 3 mi utes, with the TV set up in less than a minute.  WiFi was simply selecting my router and entering the password.  Netflix was simply entering my password.  There are so many Internet features that I haven't checked out.  I've yet to hook up the sound system or watch a DVD, or try 3D.  But, I doubt I'll be disappointed.

You can't go wrong with this TV.  But, I do recommend searching Google for ""TV sizing chart"" as you can get too big of a screen for your viewing distance or too small of a screen.  Bigger isn't always best, if your distance, from the TV is short.  You will get 'lost' in the picture and it can cause headaches, etc.

I'll update this review as I try new options.";1;4

Here are the reasons why-

1) It is imposible to use it without being prompted -at each and every use- to install ESET antivirus on your machine. If you already have antivirus, then this is the last thing you want to do since having multiple antiviruses on a single machine is a known to cause chaos and all antivirus companies urge you not to do this.

What this means is, exactly, every single time you put this USB drive into your machine and double click on the icon to start it (which you always have to) it will show a popup which you must respond to in order to use the drive. That popup asks you to install ESET. The Yes response button is conveniently colored green while the no thanks button is conveniently colored red.

Of course a large number of people are going to glance at that pop up and think they're SUPPOSED to push OK because it's the Kingston Secure Disk program. But it's not. It's a third party program - ESET - Kingston swung a deal with. So what ytou are promoting is a large number of inadvertant installs of ESET on the machines of people who are least attentive or savvy, installs which will cause them to encounter chaos when ESET starts conflicting with their existing anti-virus or visa-versa.

Normally tactics like this are used to install malware or at least PUPs - potentially unwanted programs. I guess because Kingston is a well respected disk maker nad ESET is a well regarded antivirus maker we're supposed to thin this is OK. It's not. It's slimey. Now consider that two companies capable of this type of tactice are promising to make your comuting more secure. How is anyone supposed to parse that?

Every single time I used this disk I had to pay careful attention to not install ESET by clicking on the red, that is the ""no stop! bad choice !"", button . This is more annoying than you might think and it gets increasingly annoying over time. What they appear to be banking on is one of these times, you'll slip. There is no way to launch it without going through this process.

I understand they frame this as doing you a favor. If they wanted to do you a favor, they'd have a ""do not show me this offer again"" checkbox. What they have is some kind of revenue generation deal with a 3rd party, aside from the hefty price you choked up for this disk. Hey man, grab everything you can in life, right?

Finally, one fine day this thing started reporting it had some fraction of its disk space to me for no reason. I had the 16gig version and it just decided it only had 650 MB of storage despite being empty of all content. There was no fixing it, so I destroyed it. It was about a year old

I consider this purchase to be one of my worst for the reasons given. Short life span and annoyance-ware.";5;0

Garmin couldn't rectify the problem, I figured it was designed product obsolescence. I needed a new GPS quick, and went with the 65LMT. There is a lot to like about the 65LMT, but I found the following flaws compared to the 255w.

(1) The 65LMT will not always calculate the shortest distance not matter what the settings are set to; for example: routing from Saint Louis to Minneapolis the 65LMT will route through Ames Iowa no matter what the settings are, that route is about an hour longer than the route 255w selects. Interestingly enough, Google maps matches the route the 255w selects.
(2) Even though both units have the latest maps, the maps are not identical. The 65LMT was missing some major interstate splits in Nashville that the 255w wasn't (the 65 indicated no road was there)
(3) The 65LMT's display quality sucks compared to the 255w, the blacks are gray and whites bleed out. The 255w is WAY more pleasant to view during night time.
(4) The 255w has no traffic feature, but the 65LMT traffic falls apart during gridlock. A recent 2 inches of snow put Saint Louis interstates to a dead crawl, the 65LMT showed only a 5 minute delay and showed some routes open that were grid locked. In milder traffic conditions the traffic data is useful, but you have no way of knowing whether the mild traffic being reported ahead is truly mild or  ""park your car gridlock"" until you are in the midst of it.
(5) The 65LMT has a useful feature that lets you know how far up the road the nearest gas station, restaurant, and rest areas are on your route (but it also misses some locations); on the 255W one has to pull up that information separately but it also tends to show info the 65LMT misses.
(6) Generally the 255w is much better at alerting the driver to interstate splits and which direction to take than the 65LMT. The 65LMT missed several interstate ""Y"" type splits in which it would have been nice to have an alert to bear left or right.

(7) The 255w allows one to set an access code that prevents thieves and car jackers from using your GPS to drive to your home, the 65LMT has no such feature.

Overall, the 65LMT has potentially more useful and friendly features than the 255w but the implementation of those features is less than stellar";9;2

I bought this because of the clearvoice feature which does work as advertised, and it does play clean sound, but none of the other advertised features actually work.
Anything approaching surround sound is non-existent. I wasn't expecting  7.1, I know you can only get so much out of 2 speakers, but the TV speakers actually did a better job with moving sounds.

I never could train the system to ""learn"" our remote using the directions and a call to customer service went nowhere. They just read the directions I had in the booklet to me.

Our TV is not mounted and the sound bar sits in front of the TV's IR receiver. I specifically wanted this soundbar because it said it could take the signal and beam it backwards to the TV, and that feature doesn't work either.

So basically its not awful but you can get the same sound quality in less bulky bar for at least $100 less. So my advise is skip this.";2;2

I bought one of these a month ago for two purposes:  time-shifting TV shows, and transferring old non-copy-protected VHS tapes to DVDs.  It has failed miserably at both of these tasks.

First, time-shifting.  The unit works OK on most of the digital stations I've tried to record from, but on one particular station it will consistently stop recording after about 20 minutes with the ""copy protected"" message.  Manually trying to record also fails after this happens, although if I power-cycle the unit it will allow me to record that station again, generally for another 20 minutes.  Clearly I can't depend on this for recording shows unless I constantly monitor it, and even then it's too much work and the result has gaps.

Copying VCR tapes to DVD:  When I did this with a few samples, then tried to play the result (finalized or not) on another DVD player, I found that the aspect ratio of the picture is messed up -- it's stretched vertically.  The DVD looks OK when I play it on the recorder, but I really don't want to wind up with a bunch of DVD copies of my tapes that can't be played on other DVD players.

The vertical-stretch thing also occurs when I record TV shows to DVD on this unit, then play the DVDs on my other player.  Again, this means that anything I record to DVD on this unit will long-term be useless.  The manual gave no clue as to why this was happening;  it is possible to change the aspect ratio coming out of the tuner (letterbox or cropped), but it didn't affect the bad picture on the recording.

There are a number other annoying design flaws in this unit.  Turning it on takes a looong time, probably 15 to 30 seconds, before it's usable.  The menus are clunky -- for example, to set up a timer recording you must select a top-level item, which then has ""automatic channel scan"" (the least commonly-used item on the list) as its top entry, with ""timer recordings"" (the most commonly-used item) at the bottom.  There are others, but this one exemplifies the poorly though-out design of this unit's interface.

Unfortunately, I waited too long and can't return this useless thing.  I'm planning to sell it at a loss on craigslist and buy something else in the future (before February 17th) to handle time-shifting.  You can bet I'll read the reviews more thoroughly next time.  Amazon really does us a disservice by putting all the five-star reviews on the top page, but I guess you can't blame them -- it's a business.

One more thing -- the first unit I ordered was defective and had to be returned (the DVD recorder stopped responding to commands after the first day).  This may or may not reflect manufacturing quality issues, but I thought I'd mention it.";2;1

The Audio Unlimited speakers were a snap to set up and the single speaker I mounted in my bathroom uses the batteries and I get very long life out of the NiMH C cells I loaded into it. Where the speakers fall short is in listening to music - they lack depth, bass, and volume. So I use them exclusively for listening to voice broadcasts, which they perform well.;3;2

They seem to lose their charge much faster that the Canon originals. I know all rechargable batteries lose their charge over time, but these are far worse that all others I have.

The batteries my camera came with are now 3.5 years and they still outperform these ones. I have had OEM batteries that were as good as Canon's--these are not one of them.

 Pick up of sound is very poor unless the unit is about three feet from the audio source. I have tried every possible setting for the zoom mic, including high and low sensitivity. I already own the Olympus DS 40 recorder and I compared this to the LS 10, recording the same material at the same time. The DS-40 is far superior in picking up sound. I tried the LS-10 in auto and manual recording level. Auto was very poor. There was some improvement in manual, but it had to be put very close or at maximum recording level to be effective.
  I'm also very disappointed with the the speaker output. Again, comparing the LS-10 to DS-40, I would say the volume on the DS-40 is about twice as loud. To hear anything at a reasonable volume on the LS-10 the volume has to be set at 9 or 10, and even then the volume is barely acceptable. Sound quality on the LS-10 is slightly better, but that's not much use when you can barely hear the playback!
  In the product's  literature it mentions recording bird songs with the LS-10 unit - it barely records the sounds from a television 12 feet away!  It would take a very large and very loud bird singing very close to get a successful recording with this unit! Earphone volume is okay.
  this is a relatively expensive unit and definitely not worth the money. I'm keeping to my DS-40.
  As an addendum, some have commented on my review that the two small speakers are intended only to check you have captured the sound, and are not designed to be used for listening purposes. In afterthought I tend to agree and therefore Olympus should say so and stop misleading consumers. In it's literature Olympus promotes the fact this recorder has two stereo speakers, implying improved sound quality when it is actually worse. Please give a single speaker that is audible as opposed to a gimmicky, barely useable pair.
  And finally, the worst part is that I have sent Olympus support four emails requesting information and have not received a single response. The cynical part of me wonders if they are too embarrassed to admit to a customer in person that yes, those speakers are more for appearance and marketing and actually have very little practical use.";3;1

I was really pleased with the features and how much you can customize the camera (like turning off the LEDs / IR illuminator).  It's fairly intuitive, and I'm sure a novice could get it up and running quickly - but there is more than enough options to keep a power user busy playing for hours.

The options for recording are great - unlike some competitors that force you to pay for an online service, you have plenty of options for how to get your video and you can choose up to two event triggers.  I have it send 10 pictures to a dedicated GMAIL account and record video to NAS via SMB.  You need to tweak the events and their delays because if they trigger too quickly you'll just get a text log.

There were a few bugs in the UI, for instance some features wouldn't set via SSL, but worked when using HTTP.  Go figure.

The PIR motion detection works great, I've used video based ones before and they generate a lot of false positives, this did not.  It worked so well I never even bothered trying the video based motion.

The quality is hard to determine since I don't have an SD camera handy, but I'm not convinced the HD is worth it - the Android app, for example, only streams at 480.  And the video clips are limited to 5MB so you get very short recordings, maybe 45 seconds at night and 10 or so during the day.

Now the bad - the WiFi is horrible.  Anything more than a few feet away from the router and you get terrible quality, jittery video and constant connection drops.  I was going to buy like 8 of these and put them around the house, but I really need to re-think the plan.  Basically they need to be hardwired.  This is a fatal flaw - DLINK - PUT AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA ON THE THING!  And it's not my router, my tablet - for example - that I use to position the camera gets a near full strength connection in the same places this gets none.

Two more quibbles, both with the remote viewing service - first it disconnects you constantly.  They give you a count down, but no ""postpone"" button, you have to reconnect to the camera.  Very annoying if you want leave this up to monitor something for more than a few minutes.  Second, you an only review recorded video if you use a micro SD card.

After days of searching on the web I settled for these speakers, not because they were inexpensive, but because they were the only ones I could find with specs closely matching what I wanted and because I was 99% sure they would fit all doors. Lots of speaker fitment guides say ""front"" and ""rear,"" or ""front"" and mention nothing about the rear doors.

The specs I wanted were, non-cloth ring since those are prone to fail more quickly, a reasonable frequency range that would not sacrifice the lows, and the ability to be driven with only a few watts of power from a stock head unit. After days of searching I passed on others because it seemed they either sacrificed lows for highs or were missing one or more of the other specs that were important to me. I'll admit it - I got tired of searching and this is where I pressed the button

This was my first DIY stereo upgrade in 20 years and the installation took 3 hours for all 4 doors. It could easily be done in less time if I had purchased the wiring harness but I decided to solder and heat shrink my connections. It took longer but there will never be any question about connectivity issues, and for what these cost I don't plan to pull them out years later when I sell the truck.

Now for the results. It's difficult to buy sound over the internet and more difficult to review it using superlatives, so I'll try and be as clear about the change as possible. Here are my results using the the factory Ford radio and my ears.

The lows are better than expected, about 5%-10% less than the factory OEM speakers but probably 20% tighter.

The quality of the mids is mostly unchanged in tone but the clarity is possibly 10% better than OEM's.

The highs improved by about 20% over stock and are well defined. They remain clear up to about 8 on a 10 scale, but the noise that follows above 8 is due to the stock radio.

The one spec that I could not find to fit the rest was a 90+DB SPL. The higher the SPL the more efficient a speaker is and these are 87-88dB which is near the bottom for aftermarket speakers, and because they are near the bottom there was very little gained in overall volume, although the clarity when using the same volume settings as the OEM's is improved by roughly 5% over stock.

If I had to give an overall rating for the KFC-C6893PS's against the OEM's I would rate them as 15% better than the OEM's, and with a stock radio that is acceptable. The biggest WOW factor was finding that my spec preferences were right - I improved the highs and did not lose much at all on the bottom end.

It's not an insane improvement but with everything else being stock it's difficult to appreciate any speaker. With more power I would expect these to far outshine the OEM's. I read that speakers need a break in period before they start to sound ""good"" by whatever ""good"" implies. Maybe they will get better but I got what I paid for and I'm not disappointed at all. I know I am being held back by the factory radio and no speaker on the market can make up for that.";4;2

I have always loved the convenience that Amazon brought to my life; however, as of today, I am very appreciative of their customer service as well as their value of me as their customer. I purchased a $377 Dell laptop and $30 protection plan in 2015 on Amazon. When the laptop stopped working a year later, I was advised by the seller Warrantech that the Smartguard protection plan was invalid and that I would be refunded my $30 but I would need to purchase a $280 plan to have my laptop fixed??!!!!??  Amazon to the rescue. They are refunding me the cost of the laptop $377 of which I will be using to purchase another laptop on their site and a valid protection plan from Square Trade.

I use both Windows and Mac.

1. Server console is only accessible via Windows (not just during the initial setup).  Workaround for Mac user is to RDP into EX485 and then use the server console.  If RDP doesn't work, you would still need a Windows PC.  Other feature such as accessing shares, media, etc are available from a Mac.

2. Time Machine implementation is not prime time.  WIth 1.5 TB drives x 4 of them while having a usage of about 30% of the total, I am not able to define a Time Machine drive more than 100 GB.  I need at least 750 GB to be practical.

  - HP Support seems to know about this issue but wasn't exactly sure of how it should work.  Awaiting for their response as they have escalated this to the next level.
  - Time machine share much sit on one physical drive and also on contiguous sectors.  Unfortunately, there is no way to find out how much contiguous space you have left.  And one must not use the disk too directly from the Windows itself (via RDP).  Having a fairly new EX485 with less than 30% usage total, one would think defining a 750 GB share would be a no brainer.  Think again.  You'd have to do multiple try & error to find out what the max supported size is.

Hope HP/Microsoft fix this issue.  I probably would not have purchased this had I known about this Time Machine limitation.

Another limitation that I learned talking to HP Support is that if any of the hard drives fail, it must be replaced only with the same sized drive NOT larger and certainly not smaller.";4;0

They either don't turn on at all and I have to walk over and manually turn them on (so I know they are getting power) or I have to fiddle with the remote so long that it is not worth it.

Overall I'm very pleased with this bag. The capacity was just large enough that I could leave my backpack at home. Some positives about the bag:
1) The quick-release leather straps work very well. You can get into your bag quickly with a single hand, but they never came undone on their own. Efficient one-handed access was a win several times. You never know when your other hand will be holding a drippy ice cream cone.
2) The buckles were useful in keeping the top flap snug when the amount of gear in the bag varies daily.
3) The water resistance was comforting. I never put this to a serious test, but got caught in light rain and never found moisture getting through the flap.
4) Construction, seams and stitching were impeccable. I found no fraying or loose threads. Only the quick-release slots in the leather straps showed wear, but that's expected.
5) I never put expensive camera stuff in checked luggage, so I was delighted that this bag was big enough to hold my gear and general carry-on items too. I added a couple pictures showing one way to cram this bag full. You can even fit full size headphones by straddling the front pockets. A *tiny* laptop and Kindle also fits.
6) The top handle was sturdy and worked well. The handle is part of the top flap which must be closed on both sides to carry the bag.
7) The range of adjustment on the shoulder strap was good enough for both shoulder and cross-body carry.
8) The camera insert is nice and the Velcro separators are nicely adjustable. I found I could also use Velcro separators from other camera bags without problem.

I have two complaints about this bag for which I deducted a star.
1) The shoulder strap does not include a pad. The strap is 1.5 inches wide and heavy nylon, but at this price, a grippy and comfortable strap pad should be included. I ended up buying the Matin Shoulder Pad Air Cushion Pad (pictured) which is a great match for this bag.
2) The shoulder strap is not detachable. I would have preferred a way to detach for handle carry or use a third party strap.

One final point: shoulder bags are generally more acceptable in museums than backpacks.  Twice I avoided having to check my bag in places that did not allow backpacks.  This policy is mostly illogical, but is nonetheless one less hassle you can avoid.";3;3

The Native Resolution, which is what the projector can actually display, is 1280X800 or WVGA.  What that means is 1080P signals that are ""supported"", are down converted to 720P.

The only projector that can actually display 1080P, without conversion, is a projector with a Native Resolution of 1920X1080, which is referred to as 1080P.  This projector will up convert a 480P signal to 720P or leave black borders around the frame.

Also, the specs are all over, as it claims 50.000 hours, 30.000 hours on the same page.

Interesting also how the vendor fails to mention any warranty information.  So if the 30.000 hour PERMANENT LED bulb fails after 13 months and 1500 hours, then what happens?  Will this thing become a door stop, boat anchor, or ...?????

It also claims to be able to project an image of 150"", when the brighter, higher resolution, 1080P LG PF1500 at 1400 Lumens limits its size to 120"".  A 720P image at 150"" would be screen door central, but the good news is at 1200 Lumens the image would be so dim you probably couldn't make out out anyways.

Beware of 1080P headlines on Amazon which claim projectors are 1080P, but in the fine print, claim 1080P ""compatible"" meaning they will down convert your signal to 720P.  Also keep in mind, like any LED projector, the LED lamp is permanent and non replaceable.  That means if the lamp fails early for any reason, the projector is a fancy paperweight and will never display anything ever again.

Also, 3D projectors need extra brightness to work, since the glasses dim the picture.  Don't expect 1200 Lumens to give you a usable 3D picture, assuming you can find glasses that work with it.

It is one thing to pay $200 for a no name 720P projector that might be a paperweight after 1 year, but $600?  That is a premium name brand price for a No Name China projector. sold by a a hole in the wall vendor.  I would pass and get a true LED 1080P projector from LG instead.";5;2

I tested this cable running it from an output on my mixing board into an input on my Zoom H4N recorder and am very pleased with the sound quality and lack of any noise or interference.

The cable is braided and feels nice in the hand and should resist tangling.  The connectors appear to be attached quite well and should hold up to normal use and abuse that an audio cable should endure.

Overall this is a nicely made cable that should work well connecting your devices.

First, I fully approve of the construction of the just right thickness of silicone, a material that experience has shown is a wise choice, having had the excellent Speck brand iPod case constructed of the same material for the last four years.
The nice thing about silicone is that it does not break down the way natural rubber will from oxidation, very heat resistant, and does not easily stretch out of shape.
I bought this to prevent minor scratches and dents, with this excellent zippered neoprene case&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-Neoprene-Kindle-Case-Fits-6-Display-Latest-Generation-Kindle/dp/B001NPDA44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin Neoprene Kindle Case (Fits 6"" Display, Latest Generation Kindle)</a>&nbsp;as the traveling and storage protection.
A bonus with this sleeve is that it makes the Kindle far easier to maintain a grip on, plus it prevents it from skidding off a table, and it could even be used on a somewhat inclined surface to allow hands free reading.
The case has two small cutouts on the back for the speakers, one small cutout for the five position directional controller, another larger cutout for the keyboard, and one large cutout for the screen.
This is exactly what I wanted, and I am glad that it does not cover the keyboard, which would have impeded key entries, plus the screen not being covered allows unfettered reading.
I am also extremely pleased that my fiancee's Kindle fits perfectly inside the case linked above, even with this sleeve attached.
Excellent product, and I will definitely buy another of these should I buy another Kindle, or advise anyone I know to buy one if he is considering purchasing one.
I can't think of even one complaint.

At first it looked like this would work because for many disks--but NOT ALL--it was able to display the content directory.  However, I was not able to copy any of the the files on the 8 disks I sampled.  So, is this the drive or the old diskettes?  I was able to write a small file to the disk (1KB).  I then attempted to format a diskette to see if I the drive would work with fresh tracks.  No luck with either Quick or full formatting.  I tried 9 different diskettes.  Nothing worked.

I was not able to recover the file I wanted--the reason I bought this in the first place.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that there still is the chance that all the old diskettes I tried are bad.  More likely, the diskettes are deteriorated and this reader is not made well enough to work with anything marginal.

Why else would anybody buy a diskette unit except to recover files from old storage?  If that's what you are trying to do, it isn't likely that this drive will work for you either.";7;1

To buy the SSD and install yourself is a much cheaper solution than bundling SSD in laptop purchase.

There are a few bugs though. Occasionally the laptop cannot boot (cannot detect the drive). But reboot will fix this issue. Occasionally the drive will fail (blue screen) after long hour download. It seems to me that there is room to improve.

NAND has limited endurance (write cycles). The M550 uses Micron MLC NAND, which should last longer than Samsung's 3D TLC NAND. But their prices are about the same. That is why I buy M550 rather than Samsung's EVO SSD.";2;3

Unfortunately, the quality of the workmanship also matches the price.

The eForCity charger worked great for a year, charging anything I plugged in: iPod, iPhone, bluetooth earpieces, etc. Worked in a variety of different automobiles, too. However, about a week ago, while pulling the charger out of the ""lighter"" port, the bottom popped out, dumping the end cap, flange, and fuse at the bottom of the port. Normally, I can put electronics back together after something like this, but this was Humpty-Dumpty city.

(You might have better luck if you are ""somewhat"" careful removing it and/or remember to make sure that the cap (top-right in the current photo) is tight before plugging it in.)

The shape is also awkward if you have a small car. On SUVs/Vans, there's plenty of room to plug/unplug cable. On smaller cars (when the ""lighter"" port is under a dash or bulkhead), it's a tight squeeze.

Still, the price is great: At $7 per charger, you can get two of these for less than the cost of a single USB port from most box stores (Best Buy, Walgreen's, etc) or most major manufacturers (Kensington, etc).";6;2

As close to perfection as any out there.;"To start, I LOVE THIS PLAYER! And I'll get into why later. I can't rate it a 5 though, as it's not perfect.  But it is as close as anyone has come in the portable media device business.

First, I'll start with the flaws that I've noticed, because I know people come here to look for issues with products.  However, I don't feel any of these are deal-killers.  First, the player scratches easily (I have the black one and it's only 3 months old and its finish is showing signs of wear...buy a skin to protect it! I've heard that the screens scratch easily, too, but I haven't removed the screen protector that was on it from the factory.  I suggest you leave it on.  If you remove it, I believe you can buy replacement screen protectors online.

The next issue is with the touchpad.  It's VERY SENSITIVE! However, you can adjust the sensitivity in the system menu.  I have it on ""Low"" and I still end up ""clicking"" when I meant to go up or down. It takes a bit of getting used to and is sometimes frustrating.

My last issue is with their video conversion software.  It's great that when sync'ing the player can automatically convert video on-the-fly to a supported format, however, I've found that videos captured on my camera in .mov format, don't convert properly.  The video converts and is loaded to the player, however, the file will not playback. I can FF and rewind through it, but it doesn't playback. All other videos and podcasts seem to work fine. I even reconverted the file after updating all my video codecs, but it still doesn't work, so I'm assuming it's a bug in their software.

Oh, there is one more thing: If you used to own a flash memory mp3 player, this one (or any player with a harddrive) will not give you the same battery life. For extended battery-life, make sure to run it in ""Locked"" mode.  If you leave the screen lit, you'll only get about 4-5 hours of playback. Even with the screen lit though, I can get through a day at the office on a full charge.

Other than that, this thing is FANTASTIC! The player integrates amazingly well with the new version of Windows Media Player.  I find that I don't use the Creative software for much of anything, except uploading pictures and sync'ing contact info. With this player, you're free to shop for music downloads just about anywhere, unlike the iPod. So far I've used it with Urge, eMusic, and Yahoo! Music without a hitch.

Stores and displays pictures! You can transfer pictures and play slideshows of them which is great for showing off the kids pictures to people. The 2.5"" color screen is crisp and pretty bright. The screen brightness can be controlled in the system prefs in percentage increments of 10. I keep mine at 50% to save battery life and it's plenty bright enough.  The player will auto-dim after a few seconds as well in order to spare the battery. As mentioned above, though, running in Locked mode yields the longest playback.

Music playback is great, but you'll want to get new headphones, as ear-buds aren't great.  I rarely use headphones, so it's not an issue for me.  I have portable speakers I use in the office and an FM transmitter for the car (The iRiver AFT100 works great, and I live in the NY metro-area where there's no dead air.  It will overpower weak stations, I've had good luck with stations in the upper 80s-low 90s, but I digress.)  Music is listed in numerous ways; the various catagories are: Song, Artist, Album, Playlist, Genre, and Recordings (yes, you can do voice-records with the built-in mic and record from the FM radio, too).  The player also has Bass Boost, multiple preset EQ settings to choose from, and a feature called Smart Volume, whereby it regularizes the output of your mp3s.  Don't you just hate it when one mp3 is 10X louder than the one that just played, and you find yourself stunned by the sudden blast of noise in your ear? Not with this player. While there is still variation from track-to-track, it's relatively minor.

The built-in FM radio is a nice little extra.  You can set up to 32 preset stations. Reception is good outdoors, but not great within an office building. It uses the headphones/speaker wire as an antenna. When needed, I can usually get acceptable reception by creatively rigging the wire.

In addition, you can set up a portion of the drive to act as a portable storage device. And, it syncs with Outlook, you can store all of your contact info, appointments, and tasks. Justification for having it in the office. ;)

Anyhow, I hope this review helps you.  If you buy one, you won't be disappointed as they're more flexible and cheaper than the comparable 30G iPod. I just don't like being wedded to any one company for anything and the Zen affords me the freedom to load pretty-much whatever I want on it. Happy listening!";4;3

I'm not excited.

First of all, it's not even tactical! A tactical light works with a soft-press of the switch from the off position. This needs to be completely switched on to work...and then...changing modes by half-pressing the switch doesn't always work. It usually needs to be half-pressed TWICE in every mode, before it changes the mode.

With all due respect to those who are impressed by the Vizeri's brightness...you ain't seen nothin' yet! By comparison to the majority of flashlights on the market, 230 lumens isn't terribly bright. Many are over 500 lumens. In fact, I have a flashlight from Zebralight that is 3"" tall, less than half the diameter of the Vizeri, operates on 1 AA battery, and is just as bright (if not brighter) than the Vizeri!

The Vizeri also displays PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) when operating in medium and low mode. The effect of PWM is seen when a fast moving object is being lit by the light. The object appears as a blurry, multiple image. If you ONLY operate this light on high...you'll never see it. The CREE XR-E Q5 LED was a technical breakthrough almost 10 years ago. It's not a bad LED, but it doesn't have the capacity to offer much more lumens than is already coming out of this light. It cannot drive a light as hard as the newer XM-L LED's. On the plus side, it has good throw. And the manufacturers have seen fit to not drive it hard enough to cause excess heat and premature burnout.

What I admire most about this package, is the accessories. They're quite generous. Especially the diffuser.

If you've never owned an LED flashlight before, or only had a really cheap one, then the VZ230 will seem pretty impressive. For someone like me, who owns many lights, it's pretty average and doesn't hold a candle in terms of convenient size or lumen output that most of my others do.

It's not a bad light, but it has some issues. The zoom works well and can be set at any interval you choose. The beam of the LED when zoomed out, is only useful when pointing at something 100ft or farther. This is due to the 'squared shape' of the LED which is seen in that mode.

You can use NiMH rechargeable batteries instead of disposable AAA's. You can also use lithium rechargeables; 2 16340's or 2 18350's. Disposable CR123's can also be used. Interestingly though, in my visual tests, I can't see any noticeable difference in lumen output with the lithium vs. the NiMH AAA's. In other words, it doesn't appear any brighter with lithium batteries. That surprised me.

I don't generally like or recommend ""zoom"" flashlights. Name-brand non-zooming lights can be bought for about the same price as this one. The beams on those lights are far more useful to me...and much brighter too!";4;1

I was just about to order a keyboard for my (first) brand-new iPad Air 2 when I had the chance to review this one.

I first charged the keyboard completely overnight.  Connecting to the iPad was easy and I was ready to go in minutes.

Here is what I like:

The iPad quick keys are nice to have, especially the cut and paste, find button and the ability to open other windows.  Its easy to open another window and go back to the document being worked on.

Controlling iTunes volume, forward, backward and stop and play.  Thats probably my favorite feature.

The sturdy case; it provides very good protection.

The rotating is nifty.  It comes in handy when trying to read a book since my pretty gold smart case doesnt stay up.

The excellent battery life and not draining the iPad battery which is great for a long trip.

What I don't like:

Typing my first letter, I immediately disagreed with the statement that button size, key layout are optimum for typing comfort.  Having learned typing by touch before it was called keyboarding, Im used to typing very fast.  Obviously I don't except a full-size keyboard but I find I slip off the keys easily.  I would have preferred the rubber kind.  Also, the clicking is very annoying and I cant imagine Ill be using it on a long transatlantic flight coming up.  I think that my fellow passengers might mutiny when they are trying to sleep while Im clicking away on this keyboard.

The back key is directly underneath the lock key and its easy to hit that instead of the back key.  I did it several times.

No backlighting.  That alone probably doesnt lend itself to typing on the plane.

Its black which is fine I guess but I went to great length to get a gold iPad (I know, silly right?) and a gold cover to match.  I wish it did come at least in white or red or something.

I decided not to take it on my trip even though I was looking forward to having it for the reading alone but it is pretty heavy, doesnt have backlighting and I think the clicking sound is going to drive people crazy.  And although its heavy its prone to tipping over because my 128 iPad is a little heavier.  Too bad I really looked forward to taking it.

While Im gone I will let my techie son play with it who will add his 2 cents when I return.

Here is the one I was going to get and still might.

IBSound asked me to test and review this 8GB Digital Audio Voice Recorder.  Honestly, it is an ok value at just under $24. plus shipping.  Fulfillment was prompt and packaging was excellent--protective and right-sized.  Customers get a useful range of accessories in the package: a mic, airline-type in-ear headphones and a USB cable to connect the device to a computer or USB-equipped charger.  Charging takes about four hours as advertised.

There is an instruction folder and it is written in basically understandable English.  The product is sourced from China.  Users who are already familiar with the kind of thinking that goes with MP3 players and smartphones can figure things out.  It has taken me some trial and error, even having read the instructions (which is not my typical 'guy' thing.)  For example, to move UP in the settings mode, you press the rocker bar DOWN.  Well, you can figure it out.

At this price point, high-quality materials and switches in particular won't be in the package.  I found the off/on slider on my copy to be difficult to work.  The built-in microphone and speakers are 'tinny.'  However, if you download digital music files in WAV format and play them through a quality amplifier and speaker system, the sound is glorious.  Results are better with the ear buds than with the built-in speakers on either side of the recorder.  Anyway, I would be sure not to drop this item on any hard surface even once.

Be aware that it is illegal in the United States to record private telephone conversations without securing the permission of all parties involved.  It is also illegal to record copywrite protected lectures, such as given by city guides.  Just by looking at the pictures, you can see that this device looks like a recorder and not a portable power source.  With that in mind, most of us will not need a product like this.  Poor note takers could use this in school as a back up method but no device will help slackers 'get smart.'";2;2

I was given this one to review and I had a small area in my home with a computer separate from other sound sources in the home like my home theater system and was really excited about getting this speaker to install to provide superb audio in my work area.  It does so superbly.  Audio is crisp with broad range and amazing bass.  Only thing is had I been looking for such a product ands was going to spend my own cash I would not have considered this.  I have a home theater system but live in an apartment so have not expanded to speakers in the walls and ceilings yet for movies and tv.  Thus I cannot honestly say what such an undertaking would cost.  The product description page for this item shows doing just that mixing many SpeakerCraft speakers together.  It looks like an exorbitant amount to me but I know that I spent a lot for the home theater system I have that is suitable for my apartment.

So do your research and if the price of these speakers is feasable then go for it.  The packaging was great. Installation was a breeze with great directions and the quality again was superb.  This is a high end product and you will get what you are paying for.";3;4

The connections are straightforward and the first attempt gave me white noise as others described.  I went back and re-read some of the reviews.  There is an audio setting on the TV that had to be changed from auto to PCM.  At first I got nothing but then played with the various TV input options on the back of my trusty old Rotel amp.  Nothing again so tried tape and CD.  Again nothing.  Got frustrated and looked online for more info and gave up.  An online chat with panasonic (this is a new Viera LCD) indicated that the receiver was the control unit for acceptance of the signal.  She said some adapters did not work but gave no good advise.  A couple hours later went back to see if there was anything I missed before I disconnected it to send back and saw one last set of inputs for phono.  It worked!  So, even though this was frustrating, I now have speakers working.  My advise is to try any and all input options on your receiver before you give up.  Hope this helps!  I only gave 3 stars because there were absolutely no instructions or a website for the adapter.;4;2

I also own a Nikon D5100, so, I did get a chance to try it on my own camera (although I did take any pictures with it, I checked it for fit, feel and functionality). The fit was good, it was pretty easy to figure out how to set it up (remember to put the battery door from the camera into the slot on the part of the grip that goes into the battery compartment). It is a very basic grip, not a lot of functionality, but it does make taking pictures in the portrait mode a little easier. It doesn't scream ""CHEAP!"" but if you listen closely, you can hear the ""cheap"" mantra in the background. As for feel...well, to me, it has that plastic feel to it. There are parts on the grip that are ""rubberized"", which is nice, but it still feels a little cheap. But Hey! Nikon did not make a grip for this camera, so I am thankful that someone took the time and energy to make one. The remote is a nice touch, and I am sure that the extra batteries will always come in handy. I also like the off/on switch for the shutter release button.
  If you are on the fence about even getting a grip for your camera, for the money, I would recommend this one. It gives you a little more to hold onto, and it gives you a little more balance if you are using a bigger lens. It also makes your camera look a little more professional. After you have the grip on your camera for a while, and get used to it, if you take the grip off, your camera will seem small and insignificant....
  I have the Nikon OEM grip on my D750, and it feels like an extension of the camera body...as it should. After using that grip and then going to the DSTE grip on my D5100 there really was no comparison. But, like I said, for the money, it's not a bad grip.";5;2

Now, it keeps searching for satellites. I didn't turn it on.
I can record one hour long workout, and then the watch dies that night.

I'll recharge it completely one more time, that will be twice this week and see if the watch can even behave like a normal watch, but I think the battery charging and the watch functions are broken on mine after less than 3 months of use.

That was my experience with the first watch I had, I lost it and ordered a second one.
The second one is even worse than the first.  The second one never finds the satellites, it takes five minutes to locate the satellites. So now, I have to order a new one to return this one because I don't have the packaging anymore.

""There has been many comments and questions about details on the SNF Android app. The current app supports Samsung Galaxy S3, S3 Mini and Note 2.

If you're a Nexus user- that's great- but most manufacturers take half a year to push those upgrades out, and then StickNFind would have to update the app to work with your phone.

I love that its only 1 device, there are no wires, and the quick charge. Also like that I can copy tracks to the device without installing any software, and it could be used as generic file storage if I didn't have a thumb drive on me. My main complaint is that it has poor bass. The magnet is also unnecessary, and I wish it did not have it, so I wouldnt have to worry about it potentially wiping out a credit card.

Anyway, I can wear them comfortably while lifting or jogging. The jog dial could be a little more sensitive when skipping tracks, because its a little hard to operate while jogging.

Instead of the Zappin functionality, I'd rather have the ability to swap audio types (e.g. music and audio books). Because I like to listen to music while lifting, and then switch to audio books for cardio. The audio book would functionality would need some way to skip within a track/book and auto bookmark.

I really like these, but if they come out with a new version, improved bass and more storage would be enough for me to upgrade.

Yes, this is smaller and has a sexy haptic screen BUT...  it moved the DVR buttons you use ALL THE TIME to the top of the remote. Take a look. All the ffwd, play, rewind buttons are above the screen and require and awkward finger walk or hand trick and a quick glance to access.  Just dumb.  (To compare look at the old Harmony One - buy it if you can get it on ebay - or the new Harmony Elite. The buttons you use are all within easy reach of your thumb without even looking down). Thankfully Logitech realized the error and moved the DVR/DVD buttons back down within reach where they belong. Yes, the Elite is twice as much, but for a remote you'll use almost every day - worth not being frustrated with your bargain.  Just sayin'. If you can find an old Harmony One, buy it. Still avail used. You may end up replacing the battery, but that's easy. You'll love it. It's bigger, but it works great. Or get the new Elite. You'll want to sleep with it. The bomb.;4;1

These people will praise anything that Apple makes, regardless of whether its worth the price or not. Having owned and used both PCs and Macs, I have no allegiance to either. I'm going to try to make this as unbiased as possible.

Whether you should go with a Mac or PC largely depends on what you'll use it for. These days Mac ARE PCs under the hood, they just use Apple's BIOS (EFI) and of course OS X. OS X is hands down a superior OS to Windows, however there are many applications that won't work under it. Sure you can boot Windows on Mac now, but why would you pay the premium to use Apple's proprietary hardware if your going to use Windows anyway? If your going to get a Mac make sure most of your applications will run on it. Otherwise the Macbook becomes an overpriced PC.

That said this is a review of the Mackbook Pro, so here are the pros and cons of it. Its a bit long, but I tried to point out everything.

PROS
- Beautiful, bright screen
- Backlit keyboard
- Glass cover LCD, so you can wash it without worring about damaging the LCD.
- Fast DDR3 memory
- An integrated graohics card to conserve power (GeForce 9400) and a decent graphics card (Nvidia 9600 GT) to use for gaming and graphic intense programs.
- Slot-load DVD drive, you don't have to worry about the tray.
- Firewire, a feature missing from the regular Macbook
- Nice large and responsive touchpad.
- OS X performs much better than Windows. Almost no crashes/freezes, very hard to get a virus, and faster.
- No preloaded bloatware, in fact most of the apps included are quite useful and easily removed if you want the space back.
- Decent speakers for a laptop.
- I have no benchmarks, but it seems like Vista runs faster on my Macbook even though the hardware is inferior to my other laptop.
- The thinnest and lightest 15 inch notebook I've ever encountered. I have no problem lugging it back and forth.

CONS
- It get HOT under intense use (especially above the number pad).
- The DVD drive is slow to burn and read.
- Screen resolution should be higher for this price.
- Multi-Touch touchpad takes some getting used to.
- THE PRICE.
- Despite the fact that Nvidia claims its possible to use the 9400 and 9600 in ""hybred SLI"" (using the 9400 to give the 9600 a power boost) Apple has not included the functionality. There are report that it may come with the next release of OS X.
- The HDD is realitivly slow at only 5400 RPM. They should have gone with a 7200RPM. On the bright side its possible to upgrade the drive yourself.
- The only video output port is a ""Mini Display Port"". There are currently only two screens on the market that natively support this. Therefor you need to purchase a converter to use HDMI, DVI, or VGA.
- The glass screen is VERY reflective.
- For the most part its not upgradeable. You can add memory or a new HDD and that's it. However, most laptops are either not upgradable or the ""upgrades"" are so expensive that its better to buy a new one instead.
- A minor qualm for me, and something common to nearly all Macs is the lack of an HDD access light. This can sometimes be useful. Also common to al Macs is the keyboard and shortcuts. These are different from Windows and take getting use to. For the most part neither is better than the other, its just a matter of learning a new setup.

Overall I love my Macbook. Despite its higher price you get a quality machine for your money. Its much more solid than my other laptop, and s far seems more stable. I would say that if you don't game (or use one of the few games that support OS X) go for this. If you've never thought about a Mac before, its really not that hard to get to know it. Its designed for the computer illiterate (According to Apple, I wouldn't go quite that far), so you shouldn't have trouble finding your way around. Despite the good, I still would recommend you stick with the PC if you intend on gaming. Macs are getting there, but they just don't stand up to a gaming PC.";3;3

I thought I had lost my beloved HJE120Bs, so in a near-panic I ordered these ""sport"" earbuds. They're not nearly as bulky as some of the other sets I've seen or used, and the bonus is that there is no cable that hangs down to my pants pocket and snags every single thing within arm's reach and rips the bud(s) out of my ears. That's huge.

The controls are pretty simple and intuitive; there seems to be a semi-standard control scheme across different manufacturers. I paired them to my iPhone in a matter of seconds. I left my phone in one room and went to the other side of the house, out of line-of-sight, and they didn't lose connection (although the signal did get choppy after about 30 seconds). As a bonus, I can use my Kindle charger to recharge them. The buttons are covered in plastic so they won't get sweat or liquid in them. One really cool feature is the headphone icon and battery strength indicator on the iPhone menu bar (see photo). The buds will also beep intermittently when the battery is low.

My problem with the other wireless headphone/earbud sets I've tried was ear-fit: primarily that they tended to fall out of my ears, whether from movement or the weight of the buds themselves. These buds are shaped a lot like the older Apple earbuds and are not ""ergo-fit,"" but they have ear clips to keep them in place. And that's where I have a problem with them: with all that space between your ear canal and the bud, the sound is very tinny. There's no bass at all, unless you force the bud into your ear canal. And there's no isolation of outside sounds. Further, the clips are a hassle to get onto my ears; you can't just stick them in and go like you can with the ergo-fit buds on the HJE120Bs. Also, they're not particularly comfortable.

Earbuds and colors aside, both models share components (remote controller, battery pack), but Panasonic moved those closer to the buds, solving one issue I have with the HJE120Bsnamely, that the battery pack in the middle of the cord tends to stick to the back of my neck when I get sweaty. Moving the pack closer to the ear allowed Panasonic to put a cord adjuster in the middle so that you can take up slack and make them as tight or as loose as you want against the back of your head.

Minor improvements aside, the discomfort and poor sound are a deal breaker for me. Maybe my wife will like them.";4;2

I'm a professional sound recordist. So I do know sound gear. I didn't buy this to use professionally but to help improve the listenability of audio teaching tapes that I'm having to listen to with online classes. Some of these recordings were done thirty years ago and are terrible as far as the audio quality is concerned. A couple you can hardly understand what is being said.

So I bought this little inline EQ just to help with trying to make these old teaching sessions easier to listen to. For that purpose, the Koss EQ50 works just fine.

It is a three band EQ so that makes it limited in how much boost you'll get and where it will give it. The three faders are labeled Bass, Mid and Treble and that's pretty much where they are.

You plug your device into the input, and your buds or headphones into the output. Pretty simple. And it works pretty good for an inexpensive booster. Now for the rest of the story.

The way these devices work is that not only does it have a master volume control, but three individual volume controls. That's what the faders are, volume boosts or cuts at specific frequencies. So this little unit has a total of four volume controls. The noise that others have complained about is real, and much of it is post master fader, in what can be called the final section. There is a direct correlation between the amount of power a device uses and the signal-to-noise ratio. In laymen's terms, the more power a device can get, the quieter it is. If a device is built to use the minimum amount of power, it's likely to be noisy. It's more complicated than that but suffice it to say, this little EQ's chip doesn't use much juice at all so it can get noisy.

The only thing you can do is try to pump as much volume into the device as you can before you overload the input. That way, you'll induce less noise through the faders. But since the main noisiness is post master volume, there's not a lot you can do about it overall.

So my recommendation is this: if you need a booster for something like listening to transcriptions, or old muddy sounding radio shows, or old teaching tapes, this unit may work fine for you. If you are wanting something to boost your Walkman or iPod volume, and still want to hear music the way it's supposed to sound, you should probably look to other devices.";2;2

The Garmin has significant design issues and GPS itself ultimately is not accurate enough to be useful for most running applications. Given the high price tag, this is not a winner.

PROS:
1) Nifty gadget to play with, it's fun to see your route mapped out, huge gee-whiz effect
2) Large-size digits good for older eyes
3) Rechargeable
4) HRM worked well

CONS:
1) Any GPS, by definition, is just not accurate enough for pacing or measuring courses accurately. Ultimately, I measured my courses the old fashioned way and just stopped using it.
2) You have to wait several minutes, not moving, for the GPS to find the satellites before starting to run. This is very unpleasant in cold weather.
3) The bezel ""button"" system is a disaster, see other reviews for details. Wet outside? Wearing gloves? Fat fingers? Forget about it.
4) Quality of the running log software is very poor and missing simple common measurements. Garmin seemed very uninterested in improving it when I talked to CS";5;1

This suffers from some basic design problems that even cheaper brands solved long ago:
(1) sluggish response - the video stops and stutters when advancing to the next DVD ""chapter."" It happens just often enough (1-2x/disc) to be annoying, but not consistently or frequently enough to be able to pinpoint a cause. My old player handles the same discs without issue.
(2) Incompatibility with universal remotes - I've tried to setup three different universal remotes with this unit and none of the three were  able to provide both fast forward/reverse and skip ahead/back. (This despite having used all possible Toshiba DVD recorder codes on all three remotes.)
(3) Poorly designed menus. I'm generally able to make sense of awkward interfaces and get most electronic devices to do my bidding (everyone asks me to find special features on their cell phones), but even with the manual, I'm not able to get this machine to deliver on all its promises.
(4) Bad memory for play back. My Panasonic DVD player can memorize a position on the disc so you can go forward or back or even shut the machine off and be able to return to the bookmark. It can even remember positions for at least two different discs. The only way that the Toshiba remembers where you left off is if you ""stop"" the playback (pause won't do it). And it suffers amnesia if you accidentally eject the disc or do anything but go straight back to where you were before.

On the plus side, the picture quality is great and the machine has some nifty features, including 1080p for about $100. However, I would have been far happier spending another $50 for something else.";3;1

Well, was I ever pleasantly surprised after receiving the Qy7 soundPEATS and listening to the high quality audio coming out of these tiny earphones....WOW ! I wouldn't say that they surpass large over-the-ear headsets, but they give them a fighting battle for sure. I use them to listen to music after lying down at night for relaxing and enjoying what I couldn't during the day hours. Connecting to my Razor phone was quicker than easy, and I haven't had any problems with the device disconnecting from the phone. After seeing what and where soundPEATS considers to be the ideal size and placement for the microphone, I almost died laughing, thinking ""This mic is a joke"" until 1 day in the car, while receiving a call, I remembered that I was wearing the Qy7 and I yelled to the calling party to wait while I removed it, but that person said ""why'r you yelling ? I hear you perfectly well."" So no more knocking the mic on the Qy7.
The bass is adequate without distortion & mids & highs are present & clear. My only beef is getting used to the size & placement of the operating controls. If after trying them out I were told the actual price is twice what I paid, I would still have gone ahead with the purchase. Thanks to all involved in this transaction.
UPDATE (July 26, 2015):
I just had to do it; I bought a second Qy7 today, not because my first one suffered damage or anything, but my son was over the house earlier this week, and upon spying my Qy7, insisted on connecting to his smartphone just to try them out, and that did it !! I lost them forever, as he said he would not give them back. So, here I am, buying another pair.
I do have one caveat....on the page where the article is displayed, there are various pictures, including one of a SOUNDPEATS hard cover for the Qy7. I wish that cover had been included as part of the package, but since it wasn't, I'm willing to shell out a (reasonable) amount to purchase 2 of them; one for me, and one for my favorite son. Since the photo isn't accompanied by a name, I don't know how to go about purchasing them, but I hope some one at Amazon or at SOUNDPEATS can show me the way.
Buy these earbuds, people, you won't be sorry.";4;4

The casing and the LCD display are attractive and inconspicuous, making them blend into your existing home theater nicely. It is a great appliance for integrating your Pandora account into your home theater system, and it offers a vast variety of internet station listings that blow traditional FM radio away.

However, while this device is fun and useful, it has several drawbacks.
First is that the WiFi reception is weak and lacking in quality. Someone who values high-end home theater equipment is probably not going to be impressed with low bit rate audio coming out of their expensive speakers.
The second drawback is that setting up the device to access your Pandora account is not very convenient and requires many steps and many references back to the instruction manual. Then, once it IS set up, the remote control for the device makes it extremely tedious to navigate through the menus and actually use Pandora. And while we're on the subject of the remote, it is not specific enough; it could use several more options and buttons to make it easier to access all of the features this device has to offer.
Third, as this is obviously a device meant to access internet based-radio, you will have to deal with all the usual annoyances of internet radio. Enough said.

Overall, i think it's a great appliance and i'm glad I have it, however it could use some fine tuning. Hopefully a ""2nd generation"" version will work all of these things out.";4;3

This one is a bit more innovative than many Ive tried.  Depending where Im at, I use everything from an ancient HP to a MacBook Air.  The versatility is really nice.  Seven ports is probably more than enough for most people and definitely surpasses the four Ive tried out before.  The backward compatibility helps integrate some of that old equipment with the new.  I don't generally run any complicated speed tests on hubs because my needs are relatively simple.  Transfer was definitely in an more than acceptable range for this hub.

The iClever hub works very nicely and I didn't experience any issues.  The anodized aluminum shell is a real draw and structurally should hold up indefinitely.  A small button on one end of the hub turns it on.  On the opposite end is a 5V DC input and a USB 3.o IN portfor charging.  The hubs are spaced adequately at a little under 1/2 apart.  The included USB cable is approximately 39 long and quite wide at almost 1/4.  You can always swap it out if you don't care for it.

Great design, built to last, driver free, hot swappable, and has excellent transfer speed.  The only drawback I can see is that its not compatible with the Apple SuperDrive.  It also has a slightly rounded body that some people may not care for, a minor quibble.

FEATURES:

  Robust construction and heavy duty anodized aluminum shell guarantee excellent durability and high reliability.

  Expands your computer with up to 7 USB 3.0 ports. Backwards compatible with USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 devices.

I got a bit frustrated, but if you keep your calm and go thru the steps with them, they'll get it done with you.

As it turns out, it was that one of my laptop's wireless controls was disabled since I had always had it hardwired at my old place. Since the setup, it's all good.

I've found that my service provider has a tendency to reset connections. It was like that when it was hardwired at the old place. They utilize dynamic IP addresses instead of static IP addresses, and perhaps that's a factor for the resetting every night, I don't know.";2;3

pros
being able to play back video at half speed ( other slower speeds as well) is awesome
camera takes great pics with the light being a flash or using the ir light. (no more then recomended distance for built in ir light)
battery last for 45-50 mins with lights on about 1 hour without the lights being used.
i did buy this for ghost hunting and works just fine for that once i figured out a few things. its been working like melted butter being spread on toast. if you are expecting it to be like the ones they use on tv, lol dont. you get what you pay for and im happy with the price i paid and what it can do.";3;4

the brush was dirty and made a mess on the lens! I turned the LensPen around to use the cleaning end.
The cleaning solution turned out to be some kind of black tar which smeared and hardened on the lens.

I used eyeglasses wipes & optical grade alcohol to clean the lens, but could not remove all the gunk.
There is a foggy film over the whole lens. It might be damage to the anti-fog optical coating.?.
A ring of thicker gunk remains around the outside edge of the lens. Can't reach it with the lens wipes.

Maybe this LensPen is a few years old and has been exposed to high temperatures.?.

I washed and decreased the brush, perhaps it can be used for something.
If you buy one of these, test it on some old glasses. Make sure it's not going to end up wasting half your day, cleaning up a mess..

Note: The ends of the brush 'hairs' are not enclosed, they stick out, almost flush with the end of the pen. There is no cover.
If you touch that end of the pen, your skin oil will likely end up on the brush tips. (The part that contacts your lens).
So, keep the pen in it's plastic bag..";2;0
