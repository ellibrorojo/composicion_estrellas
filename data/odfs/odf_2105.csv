I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.

Potential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.

The focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.

Sagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.

 It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.

For me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.",5

Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the ""bildung?""  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.
I do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.
If you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.",3

I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover that this was not another tale of assistants putting up with impossibly awful bosses; rather, Taylor's boss was not the problem - she's the kind of classy lady you would want to work for - instead it was Taylor's fellow assistant who turned out to be the complete psycho.

Taylor's character wasn't wildly appealing, but the story was funny, fast-paced and truly captured the lives of many assistants. I was interested, I wanted Taylor to prevail over her seemingly-insane roommate and her shallow judgemental co-workers - even when the story took some unrealistic turns, I was rooting for Taylor to win. I definitely recommend this book as a quick and fun summer read.",5

My problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into ""connected"" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (""Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)"").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.

It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.

My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.",4

It's possible I just don't like a novella length romance - I do not read them often. Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.

I feel like the focus was too much on sex and not enough on the characters and forging a romance. The sex scenes were very long and drawn out, and the characters spent very little time interacting with each other outside of the sex. I am not prudish - I like my romance novels to have sexy time in them - but this just felt like those porno movies that try to have a plot but really shouldn't bother because people only watch them for the sex. There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.

Also, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called ""NuBlood"" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.

I wouldn't really recommend this book - her knitting romance trilogy was much better. This just fell flat for me.",1

Her boyfriend spends all his time out in the back shop making ""candy"" and another man has been eyeing her. Mary knows its just a matter of time before this other man makes his move.
But neither man trusts Mary with money. Maybe they know if she has any she'll run away. They just give her enough to buy supplies to make meth and no more.

Finally Mary knows the time as come. She hunts around the rusting trailer until she finds the stash of cash from the drug deals, and then runs away, stealing their pick up truck. She abandons the truck in town, and takes a bus to Alexandria, Virginia, where she takes on her mother's identity and finds sanctuary in the shadow of a decades-old church.

But then a little girl needs Mary's help, and Mary hopes to help them. Can her past stay hidden long enough for her to give the hope she longs to give?

NOT A SPARROW FALLS was originally published back in 2002, and I'm fairly positive that I read it then, but if I did I didn't write a review. The book seems very familiar to me. Mary is a desperate woman, tired of living a life on the wrong side of the law, and yet knowing she is too far gone to return to her roots and the innocence she once knew.

The story is very well told, and not so dark as other stories I've read. There is an undercurrent of hope in this story, even in the darkness of the beginning, so you  know that somehow Mary will be able to dig herself out of the pit she's in. If you missed this story the first time, you won't want to skip it now. Pick up your copy of NOT A SPARROW FALLS for an uplifting story of hope.",3

I believe Linda's grandmother and my grandmother were best friends, for she has captured the sights, sounds and smells of my girlhood between the pages of this book regarding the grandmother character.

The reader is caught up into the sphere of spiritual warfare from the very first page, and then reads how it all plays out in the earthly realm. I know I have read the first few pages of this before and I'm thinking it was a contest that Dave Long held on conversion experience. It was so gripping then that I remember it to this day.

This story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.

This story is very well-woven. The characters are first rate developed and we see personalities clash in a most believable way. What I love most about this story is that every character grows, blossoms, and finds sure footing on their life path.

The main character, Bridie Collins, is worn out from the bad choices she has made. One day, she's had enough of buying ingredients for cooking meth and being the maid for two slothful drug dealers, so she bides her time until they both crash from too much of a bad thing. She steals the drug money and makes her getaway, calling a hot tip line to make sure that Jonah is arrested and put safely away so he won't come after her. The drug money is stolen so her plans for getting far, far away go awry. She settles in Virginia. Bridie is not her real name, it is her mother's. Somehow, taking on the name of her mother settles her spirit and infuses her soul with a modicum of peace. She is still running away from her bad choices and not facing the music, but we realize that she has some spiritual growing to do before that can happen. It may be the middle of winter, when snow swirling around, but what a garden grows in the little family that is blessed with her.

There are a couple of things that distract somewhat, and keep this story from being 5+ stars. When the paths of Bridie and Jonah part, we follow Bridie and then we're jerked from that story into the jail cell of Jonah. It does not lend to the storyline at all knowing what Jonah is thinking. The tension is better built with the fear from Bridie rather than Jonah's intentions. Also, there isn't a thing added to the storyline by knowing what Jonah's attorney is thinking or that she finally winds up out of the public defender's office and in the prosecutor's office. Those were major distractions.

In my opinion, it doesn't matter how excellently a story is written if we are led down dead end paths which do not include the protagonist. In crafting a believable story, the writer should understand that the reader feels cheated and bewildered when we don't know where we're going, there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel, and we're in the company of a character we do not know.

But don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Excellent read. Time well spent.",3

Not only was this story captivating, it left me with memorable characters and a story line that will resound with me for time to come.
NOT A SPARROW FALLS is not a fast read. It requires a willingness to really delve into it, but once I entered the story world, I couldn't leave. The situations the heroine found herself in were heartbreaking and anxious. I loved the love story. It wasn't overt or edgy, but it was sweet and captivating. How I longed to see it resolved in the end. There were so many different threads that made up the tapestry of this story. From a family suffering from the loss of their mother, to a young woman running from a wealth of bad decisions, to a drug ravaged young man and the old woman who prays for them all.
I would give this book five stars, but I am giving it four because there was a theology issue, I do not agree with, namely once save always saved.
But aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It resounded and connected with me. I will not soon forget these characters or their story.

However when I received this, I was running Leopard, not Snow Leopard.  This is not so much about using a MacBook on any platform, but rather using a MacBook running Snow Leopard.

Regardless of this, there were other limitations.  Overall this seemed to focus on accomplishing very basic tasks - common to all computers, Mac or PC - which Mac does so intuitively that I'm surprised this was the focus of the book.  I was looking for information on very specific Mac-things, such as Time Machine, how security works specifically on a Mac (i.e., no virus software), keyboard differences and shortcuts.  That sort of thing.  Mac has a lot of these, some of which are not immediately apparent to a former PC user, and I was frustrated by this lack.

This book would be best for someone with a new MacBook who is not that computer savvy on any platform.  For someone who is reasonably computer literate, this is much too simplistic, predominantly covering Snow Leopard topics that I feel most computer-literate people could readily figure out themselves...even if they've never had a Mac.

Genius is another of Apple's little features that is really nothing more than enticement to buy more music. So, here again the book is pandering again to Apple's sales dept.

Did I learn anything from this book? I wish I had. Most of it is so basic that I knew the ins and outs already. For the stuff that really had me stumped, such as a keychain disaster, it couldn't help me with at all. I found a fix somewhere else.

Be prepared to figure out everything yourself. The instructions contain obvious information like drill a pilot hole. But as for actually getting this thing set up, you are on your own.

Subtract (1) Star for Incomplete Garbage/Parts:

I purchased 2 of these to mount a monitor and tv (Both used as computer displays). If your tv or screen has the basic 100mm (4 holes) on the back, you will need to buy a handful of tiny washers from your local hardware store (I had to use 5 washers per screw  2 monitors, 8 holes, 40 washers). The screws that come with this are a half inch too long  you will not be able to secure your screen to the mount! While this is only another $6, it was a major inconvenience when setting this up late at night  I barely got to the store in time.

Also, some of the tools that come with this are just garbage. The little wrench they sent to adjust a few of the bolts bent upon first use. You are going to want to have your own tool set when setting this up. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SOCKET WRENCH! I cannot stress that enough!

Side note: This is going to be much easier with 2 people. I was able to set it up on my own, but if you have the option have a buddy help.

Pros:
- Once set up, these look great.
- The quality seems pretty top notch (although Ive only had these up for about a day)
- Everything is adjustable: You can set this up so that its very tight and doesnt move, or you can adjust it so that its fairly loose and swivels pretty easy (which is what I did)",3

Surprisingly, the unit shows up assembled in its box and ready for a quick and easy installation. I did not need the extension arms, and these were not pre-installed for obvious reasons that fewer installations require them. Of the TV wall mounts I have installed in the past (quite a few for myself, friends, family, and neighbors), this one is by far the best and at a fraction of the price of other less-quality units.

I have installed many different types of mounts, so I have a lot of experience with them.  The quality is decent, but there are some items of which you should be aware:

* If you have a 600x400 VESA pattern mount on your TV (as I did for a 37"" LG), then be aware that the extension arms are ""maxed out"" at this size, which means you have zero flexibility.  Unfortunately for my TV, the center plate onto which the extension arms attach completely covered the inputs I needed to use.  This isn't completely the VideoSecu's problem, but since there is no flexibility at this size, I had to rig it together off-centered only using two screws on the bottom arms.

* All of the mounts I have ever done have a tilt function, and this is by far the biggest pain I've ever dealt with.  Instead of using thumb screws, you have to use a wrench (cheap one included) to adjust the tilt.  It is much more difficult to get the TV held in place and tighten this way.

* Similar to the above, the mount gives the ability to adjust leveling after it has been installed.  This is also done with a wrench, but it is a big pain and is very difficult to keep level (keeps slipping) even with a helper.

* Lastly, be aware that when folded completely, the screen is not centered over the wall mount.  It is about 2-3"" to the left or right, depending on which way you fold the arms.  If you're looking for the flexibility of full motion but most of the time it will be against the wall, keep this in mind.",6

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.

1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?

2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.

3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)

4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.

5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.",3

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.

PROS:
-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need
-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)
-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!
-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.

CONS:
-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my <30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.
-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.
-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.

CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the <$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",1

Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.

The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.

The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.

Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.

I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.

The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.

The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.

The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.

I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VideoSecu-Swing-LCD-Wall-Mount-20-inch-Extension-55-lb-loading-capacity-for-LCD-TV-Monitor-Flat-Screen-VESA-75mm-100-mm-1US/dp/B000R0FG5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1US</a>&nbsp;gets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.

I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.",6

Addendum: Here's what I've learned ... I ordered the ""Kingston"" 64GB uSD card, because the ""SanDisk"" engineers acknowledge that their 64GB card can only be formatted as ""exFAT"". There is currently a problem with any of the Galaxy family devices running Android 4.0 or higher, they can not use or format a card with ""exFAT"". There is a firmware upgrade available from Samsung that will fix that, but they are not pushing it to your device because they say it's not ready for prime time yet, so you have to go to the website and pull it yourself, and use it at your own risk. The alternative is to do what I did, which was use my Linux machine to reformat the Kingston card as ""Win95 FAT 32 (LBA)"". The (LBA) part is important, as that will let you address the full 64GB minus a little overhead for address translation. The only drawback I see is that it's a little bit slower, and you can't store any individual files that are over 4GB in size (personally that's not a problem, as I don't need any single files anywhere near that size on my tablet).

Addendum 2: The Samsung Galaxy forums, and Android forums, are saying that the Galaxy S3 (only the S3) running ""Jelly Bean"" (Android 4.2) will read and format ""exFAT"" cards. A further caveat is that if you use the card encryption setting, or want to use the card in recovery mode, it can only use ""exFAT"". What this means to other Galaxy devices, if and when they get upgraded to ""Jelly Bean"", remains a mystery.

Addendum 3:  Someone bitched at me for not having my facts correct, so I decided to add this addendum.  Here are the facts:  My original facts were correct, in fact straight from the horses' mouth.  The engineers at SanDisk at first simply said ""You Can Not Reformat The Chip"", then later admitted that there was a manufacturing flaw.  If you have a chip manufactured after Jan. 2013, you can reformat it, if you have one manufactured before that, they will replace it for free.  Please note the date on my original review was Feb. 2013, we didn't know about the updated chips at that time, and I apologize.  All I can say is, if you're sure you're getting one of the newer chips, go ahead and try it ... also, go to the SanDisk website and read it for yourself, there's some caveat about the date on the packaging, an old chip could come in a package with a newer date, or some such thing.

Bottom line (as far as this review goes) is ... the ""Kingston"" 64GB uSD card will let you swing both ways, while the engineers at SanDisk say that (some of) theirs will not.",9

Once you format it to FAT32 it works fine...but there's the rub -- if you have Windows 7, the native format does not provide FAT32 as an option (only EXFAT and NTFS). I tried to format on an old XP machine, but 64 gb is too big.

I hunted around for a while and found a quick, easy utility that works - here's how:

First put the micro SD into the adapter (and hope you have great fingernails so you can get it out later.)
Insert the card into your computer card-reader (hope you got one, if not, buy one)
if Windows Autoplay pesters you for instructions on what to do, click ""open drive"" --- note WHICH drive letter you're opening
Do a google search for ""Windows GUI version of fat32format - Ridgecrop Consultants Ltd"" and pick the first link
Click on the picture and then run the downloaded executable selecting the drive you just opened.
I used an allocation size of 4096, which might not be the most efficient (it means you use 4096 bytes minimum for a file, larger allocation units mean you waste more space, smaller units can lead to fragmentation and can take longer to format and to mount) wait for the ""Done""
Now the fun part - get the micro card out of the holder -- like I said, hope you have good fingernails.
Next insert -- it should just appear and mount as a 59.2 GB of external free space.

I only said 3 stars because of the issue of formatting - would have given it 4 starts, but the packaging comes with an Android guy on the it -- you'd think they would pre-format to FAT32 -- it also claims there's an ap included to enhance the experience (SanDisk Memory Zone -- I didn't see it on the card)",7

However, if just a basic ereader will do, get a Nook Simple Touch. It's quite cheap now, plus it can last a long time between battery charges.  I've had a Nook ST for 3+ years, and it can get pretty close to a month between charges, depending on level of use.  Screen resolution is less than on more modern Kindle readers, and it is NOT back-lit, but otherwise, the Nook ST should handle all your basic ereading needs.  It is completely readable even in direct sunlight.  It's light and durable.  I have mine in a soft case to give it extra protection from accidental drops.

The best thing about the Nook is that it is rootable.  It only uses Android 2.1, so functionality is obviously limited, but once rooted, it can still read all Nook ebooks, plus you can install the Kindle app on it to read Kindle ebooks as well!  That's the best of both worlds, if you have separate books on your Nook or Amazon accounts and want to combine them all together in one device.  You can use a rooted Nook to access the internet via wifi, but keep in mind it uses e-ink, so it will be sluggish, even with Opera Browser installed.  Better to just use the Nook for reading books.",6

I would have to reset my nook, used the ""Go To"" function to skip to the page AFTER the one I wanted to read, and then go back a page just to pick up where I left off. And BN customer service is completely unhelpful when it comes to their slightly older e-readers, because everybody wants you to upgrade to their newest tablet editions with backlit screens.

Since then I have been extremely disappointed.  I only expect three things out of an e-reader and was shocked to learn that the Nook fails on two of the three counts.

1. The actual reading:
They both do the job.  In fact, I slightly prefer the Nook to the Kindle in terms of form, ease of reading, and the presence of a physical button.

2. Wifi Connectivity:
What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.  I expect to practically NEVER make a purchase from the official store.  Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every. single. time.  Unbelievable shortcoming of the Nook.

3. Software

The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.

This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99

Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!

Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!

I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.

My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.

Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.

The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.

The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.

Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",7

Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller).
However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader.
I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2"" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly.
The Nook is cumbersome:

THE BADS:
1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!! (like I am installing a new software !!!)
2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day. Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.

THE GOODS
3) I went to a local B&N store to get instant WIFI access which I did,

THE BAD
4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time). Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.

THE GOOD:
5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.

THE BAD:
6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size
7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears. I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there
8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine. But the ""next page"" , ""previous page"" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.

9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open
10) try to re-open the first one, not open either
From this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.

11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either. And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).

To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.
And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).

I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.
I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.

My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.
I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.

I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.
Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.",3

I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.

It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.

I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).

The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.

Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.  I'd recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't do a ton of reading, but still wants a simple e-reader.  If you are a more serious reader, I'd probably spring for the Paperwhite.",5

I find the reading experience with the Simple Touch great. The pearl e-ink display has great contrast, and pages turn pretty quickly. I keep the wifi off and battery life is really good. I don't think it's quite as good as BN claims (2 months reading time?) but I can go weeks without charging. I've only purchased a few books though the BN store, I mostly side-load them using Calibre, which works great.

My wife doesn't read hers as much as I read mine, and the touchscreen on hers will go unresponsive. Holding down the ""n"" button on bottom-front while holding down the top back button forces it to rebook and come back to life. It hasn't been a major issue though.

I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).

Later, I bought one from B&N, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N for a full refund.

Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N Forum has many references to the problem.

I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.

Oh well.

The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.

The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.

The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.

If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N website.)",1

There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.

I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.

If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.

Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N altogether.

I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.  Either that or hand your child your Visa and tell them to enjoy!  Now that's what I call convenience.",5

The second reader seems OK. It is less responsive now though, after the ""upgrade""...Will test it with imported through Callibre books tonight, if it is still OK after firmware update.
The third reader hasn't updated yet, I don't know why. I will return it anyway - I don't want to take the risk.

Conclusion: B&N completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update. It is definitely not worth the money right now.

I have the first generation Nook too, and in general I preferred Nook due to the epub support. I integrated with Callibre and used embedded fonts for non-Latin epub books.

I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support. However, considering that B&N is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device. It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.",3

I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N. If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.
I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.",5

- Physically buttons for Back and Forward are kind of hard To press

- No Landscape Mode... I don't understand why :(

- No Web Browser or RSS reader app or something like that

- PDF reader usually do not render properly if the pdf has Tables, Bullets, Images and other graphic different from text.

- You Can Not Delete, move or rename Files from the device User Interface, you always have to connect it to the computer to do this actions... this makes you waist a lot of time.

- The device has a hidden partition used to store the books you purchased at B&N store. You cannot have access to that partition (with or without computer) in order to delete this purchased books.

- You can not export your Highlight or Notes from the books. Kindle is a step forward with this ""most have"" feature.

- The reader does not have the option to Lock the screen with a secret password or Dots combinations like Android phoness. Remember that you have stored your credit card inside the account of the device!!

- The Home screen lacks the options for fold or expand the 3 sections: Reading now, library and Next Readings.",5

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.

For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.

The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.",3

I like the form factor, too - comfortable size, weight, and feel in the hand. I can't complain about capacity, either, not once I've added a few gig of drop-in flash.

What's middling-good: The second UI screen seems a bit odd, and the whole ""library"" organization could use work. I've gotten used to hierarchical folders-within-folders. It has one level of folders, but still has a largely flat organization. That gets clunky after you load a few dozen books. I'm not nuts about the iffy touchscreen features, either - big fingers and small UIs don't match. I've used only the basic reading and library features, so can't comment on the rest.

What needs work: I can load and store books via USB. Considering the number of free texts at gutenberg, feedbooks, and other sites, that's more than convenient. I can only load and store, though. Folders, notes, bookmarks, and all the other niceties (metadata for the geeks out there) aren't accessible from my PC, and have to be managed via the UI I just mentioned.

What's just plain bad: It loses data. All the data, right back to factory settings. I let the battery run down, then didn't use it for a month or so. When I came back - gone. All those dozens of books I'd collected, folder organization, notes, and all the rest - gone. And this has happened more than once. C'mon, guys, that's flash memory in there. It holds data even when there's no power. That's why we use it, or didn't someone get the memo?

I mostly like it, I wanted to like it, not just because I spent a bunch of bucks on it, and it has lots of features I could have explored. I now know, though, that I can't trust it. The more I would have done with it, the more time, effort, data, and possibly expense would have been at risk. No, thanks. I'll use it in limited ways, but nowhere near how it was meant to be used.

I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.

The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.

Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor.

So you'll probably see some mistakes as far as comparisons between B&N's reader and other brands. Since I'm too lazy to do any meaningful research on the competition, please take my review with a grain of salt.

Pros:
* Solid build, nice thick plastic with a rubber textured back
* Screen is sharp and easy on the eyes. I actually enjoy reading text on it!
* Removable battery
* Micro-SD card capable (up to 16GB)
* Massive collection of e-books to choose from (larger than Amazon's?)
* Not as format-restrictive as the Kindle or Sony reader
* PDF compatible
* Awesome touchscreen
* Easy menu navigation
* Ability to keep track of personal contacts via an address book
* Coupons, coupons, coupons. Check the nook every week for a new deal, plus you get free coffee if you take it into the store.

Cons:
* nook must be turned on to charge the battery, and it can take over half a day to fully charge
* Battery life is short, especially with the wireless option turned on
* e-Ink scrambles the screen when turning a page (the ""Etch-A-Sketch effect"")
* Content purchased through Barnes & Noble is only downloadable via a wireless connection (sorry, no PC-to-nook downloads for purchased B&N content allowed)
* The longer the unit is in use in a single session, the slower it responds to user interaction (page turns, menu loads, etc.)
* No optional backlight on the main screen
* The clock can't be manually adjusted, it has to sync with B&N's wireless network to get accurate time for your area
* Organizational options are sparse. You can organize by author and title, but that's about it. Sorting through sideloaded media, if you have a lot of it, can be a real pain. Also, there's no way to delete B&N books. They have to be archived, which means they are still on the nook taking up space.

A couple of firmware changes have fixed some of the issues with the nook, but there are some problems (such as the Etch-A-Sketch effect described above) that may never be resolved. I was, for the most part, aware of these issues before I made my purchase, so it was not that big of a deal to me as it might be for other potential buyers. Overall, the nook is a gorgeous e-reader (at least compared to the 1980s retro style of the Kindle), and it does its job quite effectively.

I would heartily suggest the nook to anyone that needs a relatively well-priced e-reader that has access to a massive library of e-books and various formats.

EDIT 7/14/10: After the latest software updates, my nook experience has drastically improved. Page turns are much faster, and though the Etch-A-Sketch effect is still there it's nowhere near as noticeable. B&N has added general browsing to the wi-fi; it's a pain to navigate, but the option is now there for people who need to access the internet. Games have been added- Sudoku and Chess. Battery life seems to have improved for me, as I can now run the nook several hours a night for about a week before it needs to be recharged. And, best of all, the slowdown issues I was having have disappeared entirely!",3

The girlfriend and I are trying both the Kindle and the Nook.  I'm thing the Kindle is looking better in the long run.  Issue I have with the Nook are.
1. Battery life is terrible compared to the Kindle.  I have to recharge about 8 times for every recharge of the Kindle.
2. Turn off Nook = losing place in book and on a 1100 page book that means not being able to just go to page 958 it means single forward clicking to get to the page (not a very good way to keep me happy).
3. Pages take an insanely long time (upwards of 3 minutes at times) when paging at the end of chapters most especially in PDF converted docs...wouldn't it be smart to cache the next couple pages ahead of time?
4. Screen glare...not so fun with a reading light.

Fix most of these issues and I'll be happy until then, not so much impressed.",4

Its pdf support is much better than Kindle, supporting reflow. that way, you see the page as the native format with real page numbers. it is quite readable if your file is basically text. I don't know if Kindle has improved in this regard but when I bought and returned Kindle DX six months ago, this feature wasn't there and pdf looked more like an image than text. Even DX's large size did not help me read pdf books because it was small and dimmer than regular text. Now on Nook I can read them as though they are in native format. no conversion is needed. but again these are mainly text-heavy pdf files, not complex, graphic-heavy ones.
second area where Nook is better is the screen clarity, the contrast between the background and the font is much better than my experience of Kindle DX.
Third, user replaceable battery and additional memory slot is a plus for me as I intend to use the device overseas at some point. In case of a problem with the battery, international users have to send your Kindles to the United States for battery replacement? Nook replacement battery costs $30.
Fourth, a better looking device. I don't need the keyboard but it takes a significant space on Kindle 2. the LCD screen works fine but it reflects light and consumes battery when reading so this might not be necessarily a plus. perhaps a physical keyboard that can be separated from the device might do a better job.
Fift, support for more file formats, particularly epub.
Note: Nook is speedier than many reviewers here suggest. I suspect it is due to the new software update. I was able to swipe through pages with no difficulty.

Kindle advantages:
1. slightly cheaper with no tax and easy to return; amazon.com's wonderful return policy. (so far I have bought hundreds of products on amazon, and returned only a few of them but the reason why I bought them here is because of the return policy. amazon.com is simply the best online retailer in the US with the best customer service). BN will impose restocking fees if you have opened it. But BN offers some deals when you visit one of their stores if you live near-by.
2. availability of international 3G support where you can buy books. Nook needs to catch up on this.
3. better, usable dictionary. Nook dictionary is hidden behind a few clicks on the LCD which makes it really unpractical.
4. its experimental browser which allows you to open other websites. I don't need a browser in a reader but in case of need it is a good feature.
5. better ebook library. but BN is fast catching up and the ebook that I bought yesterday was cheaper at BN by four dollars. maybe that's an exception but deserves mention. but epub/pdf availability on Nook makes it superior in my opinion. also, new devices such as Irex and Que readers will use BN's collection so more machines will be available, which will improve BN's economies of scale.

To sum up, for me the deal-breaker was pdf reflow without conversion into native format, user changeable battery and additional memory slot. These features are available on Nook but not on Kindle. Nook should improve on user interface to rely less on LCD during reading (such as dictionary), make LCD less reflective, international 3G access and ability to buy books. It is a four-star device.

Finally, kudos to Amazon to allow comments on competitor products. I did not see place on BN.com to comment on Nook. this means a much more interactive shopping experience on Amazon.",4

Just as I don't see the need to choose between PC and Mac and just keep one of each around, I don't see that this is a fight that is necessary. There are a handful of books for Nook that I can't get on Kindle, and a bit more than a handful of books on Kindle I can't get on the Nook.

The device is beautiful. I love the solid rubber backing. The aluminum backing on the Kindle sure looks nice but on a cold Colorado night I do prefer the rubber. It is really nice to see the book cover in full color and with the 1.2 update they just pushed out the device is just as snappy as I would want. Sure it's not going to win any speed contests, but it's supposed to be simulating a book. Not exactly a high speed sport. Page turns seem to be just the same or only very slightly slower than my Kindle 2.

The free comedic articles in the Daily section are quite funny and the intersting things that pop up when you take it into a Barnes and Noble store are quite fun.

I am disappointed in some of the ommisions from the book store though. EVE: The Empyrean Age and the JPS Student's Tanakh were two things that I have on my Kindle that I read often that are no where to be found on the Nook. In fact there are no Tanakhs at all for the Nook, but a good bakers dozen Christian Bibles. If I were more paranoid I'd probably be offended by that.

I do like the fact that the nook can take ePub books though. I can always pop over to Diesel Books and purchase my missing books and transfer them straight over, which takes a bit of the sting out of the missing library.

All in all I would recommend the Nook to anyone who lives near a Barnes and Noble. I am just not quite sure I could recommend it over and above the Kindle at the moment. Perhaps if and when they expand their book selection that could change.",3

The battery life is misrepresented by B&N. The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.

The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N. Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.

If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.

A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.

A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.

Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.

Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library. I'll try not spill my soup on the NOOK while reading and eating -or it would become a SOUPER-NOOK.",3

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.

The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.

Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.

For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.

Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.

PROS
Good resolution
Touch is good
Great balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tablet
Has Play installed
External memory card option

CONS
B&N OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly Bean
Speakers are just OK
Very limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devices
Charger plug is very tight on both of my models. Perhaps it will loosen up over time. Never had a tablet exhibit this in the past.
Lack of support from the aftermarket in terns of ROM availability.
No camera
Old slow Wi-Fi hardware, and you will notice this. Download speeds compared to my other tablets is very slow.",7

It seemed to work OK for e-publishing, my main interest, and an occasional NetFlix or YouTube streaming movie to unwind.

It worked fine for 90 DAYS on post-production of one of our lastest e-books ... then the screen went black, ... just white letters NOOK slowing fading, fading to black. With my production files now locked inside. Que?

I tried plugging it into my PC, hoping it was a charger issue. Nothing. Bricked. Tried the long double button hold trick. Bricked.

I contacted B&N. They gave me an 800 number, which turned out to be a couple in Ecuador (I asked) on a crackling dial-up line, who took my credit card number before they would ship me a replacement unit, then just as they were issuing the RIN, the line conveniently went dead, after an HOUR of international long-distance.

I contacted the nice couple again. This time I got the guy. He had a macho tone of voice. I told him I got cut off. [crackle, crackle] He took my credit card number and address again, then just as he was giving me the RIN, the line went dead.

I immediately contacted my credit card company and burned that card.

Then I flamed B&N that I had a BRICK with all my files trapped on it, that it was well within WARRANTY, that I had wasted TWO HOURS with desperadoes in Ecuador stealing my credit identity, and I wanted a REPLACEMENT.

B&N first auto-sent a FAQ. Hold the two buttons long time. Recharge, lida. OK, Joe?

I sent another FLAME subject line, REPLACE OR REFUND, and this time got a human response, who took down all my sales information, my sales invoice, model, serial number, credit card and address ... then never sent the RIN!!!

And they never sent a replacement!

You are just pouring your money into a hole in the ground when you buy a Nook. Then one day it will freeze up with all your apps and files like a BRICK. And you'll hold that BRICK by your couch, week after week, waiting for a replacement that NEVER COMES.",1

Since then, I have memorized the use of my Nook inside-out, and know all the Pro's and Con's.

Pro's
1. Very user friendly. Has an easy to use menu button that lets you hop from one place to another on your Nook. You are able to put allot of your personal content on the home screen, making it really easy to get to your favourite apps and books quickly.
2. Great storage. The Nook Tablet has 16 GB built in, and the memory is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD[HC] Card. Content stored on card runs pretty fast for a Tablet.
3. Best-ever e-book reader. Its nothing that can be fought againsed: Nooks are the best e-readers of all time. You can change the size of the text, background page color and picture settings easy. Has a built-in dictionary that can be used to look up words that you don't understand in that new Hunger games best-seller, or just to look up any random word when reading Pilgrim's Progress. Overall, a great E-Reader.
4. Large selection of apps. The Nook store always will have the newest Fruit Ninja app, the new temple Run and much more. ranging from gaming apps to apps that will help your business thrive, the Nook store has it all.
Con's
1. The processor. Sometimes the Nook will run into reboots that can take up to a minute, though they never actually seem to help the Nook itself. It can't handle that many downloads at once, which can make your downloading of the Angry Birds series.
2. Hard to unlock. Unlike allot of other tablets, Barnes & Noble really have this one guarded. It is very hard to hack it (Legally)to get all of the Google Play apps. There's a card that can do that, but it costs $50. So, not the best for the techy-app types.
3. Poor speaker. The Nook's speaker isn't the best. Even at full volume it isn't that loud. The only way to really hear anything good is with headphones.

So, it seems like there's some for getting it and some for not getting it. But it sure works for me. At least it has a better e-reader than the Kindle Fire.",2

And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&N Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.

IOW this is the old model :)

So if looking for that ""new, on sale"" tablet by B&N like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.

As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.",1

As a result, what you get is pretty limited.

It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).

Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.

You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.

You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.

B&N gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.

On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.

For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.",5

The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:

There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.

The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.

So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.  When planning future upgrades.  I would advise Barnes & Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.  We are not an insignificant market segment.",3

The display is beautiful, crisp and clear. No doubt about that!  For viewing movies it's superb!

But.....there are a lot of things BN needs to fix --- fast!  Things that the Nook Tablet HAS and this one does NOT!

The Setting interfaces in books and video is now so UN-user Friendly that it is irritating.  On the Nook Tablet, which watching a video, if you tapped on the screen, you could easily option the Brightness setting bar.  Not now.

1) Never mind.
I STAND CORRECTED.  As of 11.30.2012, my Pandora app works.  B&N must have heard our cries!

2) It does not play Flash videos.  Boo!  This is, admittedly, a problem with many tablets out there.  Many websites are getting away from Flash but for now, you can't watch a website that uses Flash.....except with a very untrustworthy app download.

3) it freezes sometimes after wake up on books.  You have to sometimes re-start the darn thing.  NOT good!  It'll get stuck when you turn a page, even with the animations off.

4) In the Night View, when the Brightness setting is all the way dimmed, (which helps in Power saving) is too dim. NC is much better, still dim but not unreadable.

5) The font size in all areas, all apps (settings, email, contacts, Nook Friends, Pandora etc.)  is ridiculously small. It's even smaller than the font size on the NC and Nook Tablet and it's a bigger size item.  And there is no way to make it bigger.  Nice.  Not.

As you are reading a book, if you tap on the screen to access the chapters, page slider, font size etc. ---- all of that is way too small and where the heck is the Brightness Slider? Oh, that's right ---- it's not THERE any more!  Who's idiot idea was that?

6) when you tap on a word to access the dictionary, it often freezes or is unresponsive.  Then when the dictionary options do come up, and you tap on Look Up, often THAT freezes. Say what? Oh, and when the definition does appear, the font is so small, it's almost unreadable.
I normally read my books in a much larger font size and on the NC/NT, the definitions are readable.  Even though this tablet does have Text to Talk, it's not that great and I don't want text to talk, thank you.

7) The web browser does freeze often but this was a big problem with the NC/NT  too.

8) when watching a movie, you cannot easily access the Brightness bar, and when you try to tap on the Movie slider to advance or go back, that sucker disappears faster than you can ever imagine.  On the NT, that slider stayed for at least a few seconds, enough for your finger to get on it.  Very annoying.  Also, again the Brightness button is not easily accessed.  You have to tap on Settings, go to the Brightness setting, adjust it and then find your movie in the Main Menu and reopen it.

9) The keyboard is a joke, as it was on the NC/NT.  Come on, how hard is it to have a ""qwerty"" keyboard with numbers at the top.  All other tablets have that.

10) The Brightness button in not on the tool bar when you are in the book reader as it was in versions past.

If B&N had kept all the aspects of the Nook Tablet, adding the gorgeous HD display, the larger, less bulky hard drive, and the more robust processor of the HD+ , the Nook HD+ would be a winner-winner, chicken dinner!

Hate to say it but:
My husband has the new 10"" ASUS HD tablet and I think that's actually a better buy!  You just download the Nook app, which does allow you to view the magazines as on the older Nook Tablet, by the way. I didn't check if the kids' books work (i.e. read to you).  I feel bad I cannot return it, as it's past the 14 days.  I'll keep flogging away it, as it has some very nice features!",4

I lowered the number of stars on my review because a month out of warranty the NOOK HD+ has now started malfunctioning.  The screen flickers on and off.  If you twist the outer edges a little you can usually get it to start working again for a minute or two.  The Nook was well treated and never dropped.  So while it worked fine for a year... two months out of warranty it is now a paper weight.  So I have lowered its rating from 5 to 3 stars.

Original review:
A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9"" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.

There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9"". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.

We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a ""rooted"" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.

This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8"" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.

We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8"" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8"".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.

Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.",8

This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.

Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.

Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.

Spend your $200 on a real tablet.

After Barnes & Noble knocked $100 off their lineup to stimulate sagging sales, the Nook has emerged as the greatest tablet value out there.
Don't let the economical pricing fool you. There's nothing wrong with the Nook. This is a solidly constructed, responsive, quality tablet that is fun - and a joy to use.
.
I've seen economically-priced tablets that are better suited to be used for target practice.

I purchased my Nook HD+ 32GB over a year ago, and have never regretted the choice.
Loaded with a 64 GB micro SD card, this thing has extraordinary data storage capacity, and with
the advent of Google Play,  Nook is definitely a major player.

Keep in mind: any movies purchased from Google Play download only to the Nook's onboard memory; however, movies purchased from Barnes & Noble may be defaulted to load to either the memory card, or the onboard memory.

Between purchases made on Google Play and B&N, there are curently 22 movies downloaded to my Nook. And there's room for at least 22 more.  Ebooks load in either the EPUB or PDF file format.  As a reader, this is as good as it gets.
The audio on this thing is amazing, and the video really pops.

The Nook sells itself:
After I downloaded 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', a  friend watched the first few minutes, and was so blown away, he immediately ran out and purchased an HD+ of his own.
After seeing my Nook in action, several friends promptly got their own.

Due to an understandable conflict of interest, Amazon video isn't compatable here.
Nook owners have to suck it up and settle for Netflix and forget about using Amazon Prime's wonderful video library.

And hey:
You don't have to be a NASA engineer to use this thing: Complementary tech support is available
at 800-842-2665.

Bottom line: This is a wonderful piece of equipment and an unbeatable value.  If you feel it's time to enter the tablet market,  this is a good place to start.",2

Shame on you B&N","Hi folks,
  I have just purchased a brand new Barnes & Noble 16 GB Nook Tablet. I've been wanting an eBook reader for quite awhile, so I was really excited when it arrived by FedEx this morning.
  I'm a disabled American Veteran, and on a very limited income, so I receive a small allowance each month for my personal items. I had to save for several months in order to purchase an e-book reader. I did a lot of Internet searches, reading, and comparing features before choosing the ""Nook"". I also based my choice on past experiences with Barnes & Noble (book stores). I never expected them to ""ROB"" me as they did.
  I bought the Nook with my own money, and it is mine. Shame on you B&N for stealing from a loyal (ex) customer. I trusted you and you stole from me.
  If any of you are thinking about a Nook, ""Be YE Forewarned"", B&N has a nasty little bit of firmware just waiting for you, on the Internet. This little thief will lock up your Nook so you will only be able to download books and apps from Barnes & Noble.
  You will buy only the things they sell and you will pay their prices. There are so many free apps and ebooks available, but you will not be allowed to have them, if you purchase a Nook. If I had it in my power, I would have everyone to buy some other brand and teach the ""Big Guys"" a lesson on how to treat people. Had I known about this ""Hi Jacking"" of my property, I would not have purchased it. I hate to sound like I'm pissed off, but I am pissed off.
  With all the nice features, the Nook would be a great piece of technology, were it not for the stinking little virus waiting for you out there in Cyber land.
Tom Mullis
PS: For those of you who know how, you can do this thing called, ""rooting"", but there are many of us who are not able to do this procedure. And I'm pretty sure Barnes & Noble will soon write a piece of software that will take the Nook back, and prevent you from doing it again. The folks at B&N are not dumb, they will figure it out. They are not dumb, but they are crooks, willing to cheat and steal for that, ""almighty doller"". So beware.
  By the way, are there any lawyers out there willing to take on a ""class action"" suit? I do hope so. Tom",6

This is not a tablet PC. If you manage to root this device (voiding your warranty) you still won't have bluetooth, GPS, a camera, HDMI, nor the ability to easily connect your Nook to your monitor, TV, printer, keyboard, or mouse. You will only have internet access when you're near wifi, no option of 3G service.

If you're looking for an e-Reader, just buy a regular e-Reader. The reading experience on the Nook is NOT the same as classic e-Readers, which seem to have more of a paper appearance to their screens. Reading on the Nook is just okay and is best in sunlight. I'm not too thrilled about reading on this while in bed, for instance, as it's not as gentle on the eyes when compared to regular eReaders. If you're not used to reading on a regular eReader, this might not be a problem at all for you. If you like the eReader experience, these types of devices will disappoint. While you can change the background color and dim the screen, it is a far inferior reading experience.

I, personally, purchased this device believing there would be some setting that would make the reading experience like one on a regular eReader. While the Nook has a lovely screen and beautiful Netflix playback, it's not a good eReader unless you're reading a lot outdoors.

I bought this knowing that the app selection was poor, but not realizing just how poor it really is. B&N seriously needs to open up this device for more learning apps. After my initial disappointment, I just figured I would let my children have my Nook. It *seems* to be great for kids as they can use the various learning tools, and they're more likely to reread books than I am. But, when it came to looking for various math, spelling, and other learning material for my 7 and 10 year old sons, the selection was dismal at best!

It's cool to play Angry Birds on a larger screen to the tune of 3 bucks per version... and Drawdle is a huge hit with my boys, but the excitement sort of ends there. The excitement really ended after I paid 2 bucks for a spelling app that isn't even compatible with my device. The way the market is locked down, that shouldn't even be possible! As for Netflix, well... how many places will I have wifi and the time and ability to watch a movie also? At home I can just watch Netflix on the big screen TV. It would be most useful for long car rides if you have mobile hotspot on your phone. But, of course, streaming from your mobile hotspot will just eat up your monthly usage!

All in all, I say it's a very confused device. If you're looking to buy this, save yourself the money and just buy the Nook Color for $169. The tablet is a little faster and a little lighter in weight, but $250 sort of exceeds this device's usefulness. I was also planning to read library books on my Nook... only to learn that I don't have access to the Overdrive app in order to do so. If there is some roundabout way to accomplish this, I just haven't put in the time to investigate.

I honestly think this device is best suited for kids just because big touch screens are fun. In the end it's an over-sized android phone without the market... or the phone lol. It's a cool toy for a kid (maybe 8-18 years of age) to have for the family on a budget, I guess. But to me, it's starting to feel like a waste of money. I'm not too keen on the reading experience, and while both of my kids are just dying to get time on the Nook, the learning app selection is *severely* limited. However, as my kids aren't as picky as I am, they would actually get some use out of this device as an eReader. Yet, since this doesn't seem to be a device designed for kids, I do wonder how long it will take them to break it. =-p",1

One reviewer reported even the B&N tech person in the store was unable to enable the Nook Tablet to download library eBooks.

EBooks cannot be directly downloaded onto the Nook.

According to my librarian, B&N has made this a more complicated process than on the Kindle Fire, needing more steps, but the Overdrive Platform accessed through the library website which uses the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application provides the needed interface to bring the library onto the Nook Tablet through your home computer.

My county library system has a Downloadable Library that is powered by Overdrive.com.  Overdrive works with thousands of publishers to distribute eBooks to libraries, schools and retail establishments like B&N.  With the help of the reference librarian at my city library I was able to successfully link to the ""Overdrive"" website through my library's website and then download the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application onto my home computer.  The Reference Librarian talked me through parts of the process on the phone. I called twice for help not wanting to tie her up while I went through the registration process.

This Application is offered free from Adobe.com but does require registration with Adobe to access and download it.  The library eBook editions are then downloaded and stored on the home computer through the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" Application.  The digital book copy can be transfered from the home computer to as many as 4 other digital devices (Adobe allows for this), but each digital device must be authorized before downloading the very first eBook.

This was a long and overly complicated process it seems to me, and it took close to 2 hours for me to complete all the steps and then download a library book through the library's Downloadable Library site to the ""Adobe Digital Editions"" platform on my computer. I finally was able to transfer the eBook from my computer onto the Nook through the Nook Tablet's USB cable connected to my computer. My husband made sure that we safely disconnected the cable from the computer through a pop-up from the task bar before physically separating the Nook Tablet from the cable connection.

Through this Adobe application I am able to read the downloaded eBook edition on my computer.  I put an icon on my desktop for quick access the platform. And ... I can read the book on my Nook Tablet as well. Hopefully the next eBook I download from the library will be an easy and swift process since all is now in place for this to occur smoothly and quickly.

I have done this once and it worked perfectly, but downloading an 874 page book swallowed 60% of the Nooks 1 GB of memory that is designated for ""My Files"" on the device.  I await the arrival of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SanDisk-32-GB-microSDHC-Flash-Memory-Card-card-only-SDSDQM-032G/dp/B004G60AD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SanDisk 32 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card (card only) SDSDQM-032G</a>.  There isn't a lot more that can be downloaded onto ""My Files"" without it.

This is the first device of this sort that we have bought (no cell phone or Ipod or other such devices), so I have few expectations at this point. Downloading library books was of critical importance for me.  I actually like the Nook. I love the Pandora app that comes pre-installed. Beautiful color screen with crisp images. I like that I have web access and can email things I want to read from my main computer to the Nook or download an article from the web and store it in ""My Files"" to read later.

I have another week to decide if this is a keeper.  I'll update this review if there is more to say.  I might change my rating then.  Only 3 stars now because of the already known and often discussed limitations, the expensive apps and the overly complicated library download process.

Hope this helps.",8

I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.

I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N's app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.

My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.

Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.

The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).

As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.

My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.

We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).

I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.

It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.

However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.

I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.

I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.

So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",4

Also discovered another negative... When browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites EXCEPT AMAZON, now fancy that.  It will stay on amazon about 30 seconds then pop back to where ever I was before web browsing.  I've tried it over and over does it every time.

Thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook.  it is more complicated now but doable.  I'm debating about giving it a try.  Updated 1/22/12

There are things to like about the nook, BUT

No android market
B&N wants your credit card to download FREE apps -  ain't gonna happen
stuff that is free on Android Market cost money at the B&N app store.  I.E. Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.

I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N blocks attempt to root the device.

BOO HISS ON B&N.

I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.

If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.",3

Put on CM 10.2.2 (Android 4.2.2) last week.  I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.

At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.

===========================
Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.

===========================
Original review, Dec. 2011.
===========================
First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N's site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:

A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:
-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N
-  Browse the web on a tablet
-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple prices

Get something else or modify it if U want to:
-  Buy a full selection of games/apps
-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.
-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.
-  Play mpeg videos
-  Watch YouTube

If U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.

The Details:
============
My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.

While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.

I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.

I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:

Issue #1: Onboard Memory
========================
Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.

Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:

Issue #2: App prices and quantity
=================================
2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.
-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.
-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available
-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.
-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.

YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.

I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.

I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....

Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations
===========================================
The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.

This is ironic - B&N had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""<"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.

(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).

Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations
===========================================
I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.

I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.

Issue #5: UI Inflexibility
==========================
U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.

Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.

Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable
==================================================
Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.

Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved
==========================================================
An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.

Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet
=====================================
Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).

Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.

It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.

Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.

Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect
===============================
The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.

Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound
====================================
Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.

Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250
========================================
When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",2

At the price point the hardware is truly magnificent with a wonderful screen, fast processor, good storage capacity and an SD card. I didn't need the GPS and cameras that are 'missing'. The 7"" form factor turned out to be ideal for my purposes.

The selection of eBooks from Barnes & Noble is excellent and even the magazines I bought are more than readable. Netflix video quality, while not High Definition, is certainly High Quality and is simply stunning with the right movie and since I am a Netflix streaming subscriber already, was 'free' to me. So far so good.

Here's the rub. The selection of apps from B&N is truly pitiful. I mean, worse than you can imagine. Now combine this with the fact that the standard email client as installed on the NT is very basic and limited and the standard web browser is little better. There are no replacements in the app store. None. What you see is what you get.

And something else makes it even worse. You can't add your Google accounts in order to sync with Google services such as contacts, calendar, reader etc.

The sad thing is the hardware is MORE THAN capable of running all these services but is being prevented from doing so by the B&N tablet software and their 'walled garden' approach - similar to that adopted by Apple but without their huge app store and connected services to create the illusion that you are not in an ecosystem prison.

There were originally two ways that NT owners could enhance the tablet but B&N are now attempting to close both of these paths with their latest operating system 'upgrade' (version 1.4.1) that is automatically installed on your Nook Tablet when you connect to the internet. They issued this 'bug fix' release on December 23rd. Bah humbug is right.

1. 'Sideloading' of applications was possible on version 1.4.0 and this let you install applications from sources other than B&N's paltry selection. So, for instance, you could install Dolphin Browser for tabbed web browsing and gesture input or Skitmail for a real email experience. Now that's all gone and you get no option to add apps that B&N don't have - which is most of them.  My guess is that for most users, sideloading would have resolved the issue of the inadequate B&N app store. had they been smart, B&N would have delayed implementing the blocking until they could dramatically increase their selection of apps.

2. 'Rooting' the tablet is a way to bypass the B&N controls and open up the tablet to the full Android experience which not only means access to the Google market and Google apps but also to 'superuser'  functions to enable enhanced control of the operating system. This is not for novices and requires some technical understanding of the Android operating system so likely only a very small number of advanced users would ever attempt this. B&N have attempted to block this too. Really? What exactly is the point B&N?

So, what we have here is a truly excellent piece of hardware with a fantastic eReader infrastructure capable of doing so much more than it is permitted to do by Barnes & Noble. Their motivation is to force users to buy only from them - which as Apple have proved - is perfectly okay if you make the selection big enough. Problem is, the selection is totally, hopelessly, unbelievably inadequate. Barnes & Noble will still have a huge hit on it's hands because many people have relatively simple needs. The pity is it could have been a massive home run in their battle to stay alive in the space they compete for with Amazon.

So what to do? With a heavy heart I will likely return my gorgeous Nook Tablet and spend just a little more for a real 7"" tablet upon which I will install a Nook app and be very happy. I simply don't have the time, patience or inclination to fight a company that has proven it just doesn't 'get it'.

Being a tech geek, I decided to go with the nook because of its superior specs and the fact that I prefer the nook reading experience better than the kindle one.  After doing my homework and playing with the tablet in the store I felt I made the right decision until I got it home.

The nook market absolutley ruins this thing to the point I am looking to root it.  There are next to zero free apps and despite already knowing that the tablet would not honor the apps I already own in the android market for my phone, I never expected in a million years that APPS THAT ARE NORMALLY FREE IN THE ANDROID MARKET ARE OVERPRICED EXTENSIVELY.  For example, Angry birds seasons is free on android market.  Its $3!!!!!! on the nook app market.  This is rape.

And if you are expecting to root this device, it appears barnes and noble is aggressively patching their device to disallow the use of outside apps.

If you want to read books only, get the nook color or an e-ink device.  If you want a tablet, This will only frustrate you.  I feel violated and disappointed I overlooked the pricing on the market.",2

I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N's concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.

On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.

And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N account with the new address and new B&N password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.

So, if you're into ""going green"", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.  Everyone will be happier.",2

I bought the one with the memory slot and LOVE that feature. The glowlight and memory card slot are what sold me to buy the Nook and not any of the other E-readers. I fought getting an e-reader for years as I love the look and feel of a real book in my hands. My library also has e-books I can 'check' out without leaving my home. Another fantastic feature! And with book sharing from Barnes and Nobles... I couldn't fathom why anyone would want to buy any of the others. Still don't for that matter. The glowlight, if you are a big time reader and like to read in bed next to a sleeping spouse, is perfection. The light isn't intrusive and my husband is finally able to sleep right through the soft glow in the room as opposed to reading on my cell phone with that light. The battery also lasts me through an entire night, even with the glowlight on.

Fast forward one year. I set up both bottom buttons to forward me to the next page. Around the 6 month mark the one I used most often gave me problems. I hit it and around every 2 to 5 times of hitting it to forward just one page, it goes nuts and starts forwarding and wont' stop. I have to hit the back button over and over to try to make it stop. Then I have to work at finding what page I was on. Fast forward another 6 months and the other bottom button is now doing the same thing. I can switch what the outward buttons do, so I can set up another one to forward through, however I'm worried that in another 6 months that one will go bad too. This is the main reason I am giving it 3 stars.

I have dropped my nook several times and I have not had the cracking problem. But I do get little nicks in it once in awhile that you can only see when the glowlight is on. I get them when something is dropped onto the nook. But I haven't gotten lines or major cracks. Just little tiny ones. Oddly enough after I clean the screen really well and let it rest it often clears up on it's own. I don't understand why or how it works, but am happy it does.

The other problem that bothers me is it sometimes garbles. Meaning it has two or three pages overlapping on one page. I've talked to everyone that has other e-readers (all the other brands in fact) and all have the same issue. That garbling is a problem on all of them. It's a simple fix, you simply go back a page and then go back to your page and it's gone.

I bought a leather case that makes it all a little heavier, but it also protects it from any major fall since I seem to drop everything at least once a week. I also use the lid part to block even more light for my husband.

All in all... this solid book lover wonders why she waited to get an e-reader. I use a program to make sure I label the books with what number each book is in a series. So when I am done reading one book I simply hit two buttons and then touch the next book in order. And I'm reading the next book within 10 seconds or less. I don't have to get up, I don't have to go find the book. Since I labeled them as what book number they are, i don't have to go figure out what book is next.

All of this time and I haven't bought a book from using the wi-fi. I simply go online and look for the cheapest version and buy it and then put it onto my memory card and go read it.

The only thing a book lover is truly going to hate when they go to an e-reader is that they buy the brand new book, in book form. online for around 8 dollars and the e-book is always around 15. Doesn't make sense to me. Publishers only allow books to be submitted, these days, in electronic form (generally word) and therefore it's already in an electronic form. So it should be the same price, or cheaper, in my opinion.

But you never have to leave your home, never have to get dressed if you are in your jammies, and never have to wait for the book to ship to you. Buy an e-book and you have the book immediately. Though the main problem I have been having is many authors books are only in mobi form, which ticks me off. Which means I have to buy and download the book and then have to use a program to convert it to epub.

I only have used my memory card to keep my books on. I have a 16G and so far I think I have around 400 books on it. When it's full, I'll just get another card. That way I can keep my library with me and not up in the air where someone could choose to shut down an account and leave me without my books. That and I love having my library at my fingers and yet not taking up tons of space in my house. All in all.. it's been a hard and drawn out move for this book lover. But I'd jump and do it much sooner if I had to do it again. When nostalgic, I go pick up one of my real books, hold, read a little from it. Then can go back to my nook. My favorite electronic in the house.

UPDATE: 3 years. darn thing isn't working right at all anymore. Really bummed! Love my e-reader. I probably have hundreds of hours on it. wondering why it isn't lasting...",6

1. The actual reading:
They both do the job.  In fact, I slightly prefer the Nook to the Kindle in terms of form, ease of reading, and the presence of a physical button.

2. Wifi Connectivity:
What the **** is the point of having wifi if you can only use it for downloading purchases from B&N.  I expect to practically NEVER make a purchase from the official store.  Instead I use an e-reader for my personal files (textbooks and news articles for example) and am left having to connect the device to my computer every. single. time.  Unbelievable shortcoming of the Nook.

3. Software
I can't see how far I've read, I can't edit file names, AND WORST OF ALL I CAN'T DELETE???????????!!?!!?!?!!?!  wtf B&N, wtf.

This product is really just awful in comparison.  Annoying to say b/c I was unhappy with Amazon in relation to what happened to my Kindle.

I was in love with this thing at one point in time. However, it has a horrible defect that I just cannot live with. If you sideload your books (add your own books to a memory card instead of purchasing from Barnes and Noble), everytime you turn the device completely off and on (like in the event of it freezing, like mine's has done more than once) all of your shelves (like collections on Kindle) will erase. Disappear, your shelves are empty. It also happens if you disconnect your Nook from your Macbook the wrong way.

As a person with around 800 sideloaded books, this is completely unacceptable. I need the organization. As a girl with Aspergers Syndrome, I REALLY need the organization. I even contacted Barnes and Noble's customer service online, but their reply was practically calling me a liar. ""Thanks for contacting us....Shelves only erase if you reset the Nook or deregister the device....Thank you, Goodbye!"" Really, how are you going to ignore a problem that I can replicate on demand?! A quick Google search will show that I am not the only one, and others are having the exact same issue.

So to recap, Barnes and Noble only gives you 250mb (yes, that's megabytes) of storage on the device for your own books. The rest of the space is reserved for Barnes and Noble purchases. I was okay with this because you can add your own MicroSD card up to 32GB (WAY overkill for books lol) for storage. But Barnes and Noble has gimped this feature with this horrible glitch and refuses to fix it or even acknowledge that it even exists! It seems to me that they have found another way to force you to buy books from them instead of other sources. Isn't that a little sneaky?!

Barnes and Noble has horrible customer service, so if you are used to Amazon's amazing service stay away from this company. It is (or was) my favorite bookstore and I used to visit and purchase items weekly (it smells wonderful in there!). I should have frequented Borders more, so they wouldn't have gone out of business here in the South. (Yes, I'm saying I have the purchasing power to save a whole franchise. Just joking :-) It's no wonder Barnes and Nobles are closing all around me, shouldn't you try to please the customer and not call them a liar, so they'll come back? (RIP, I'll still miss them even though I'm upset right now. I just really love bookstores and books).",1

while the plot was at times interesting [it has all the predictable elements of 'gritty' noir fiction], there were too many expository diversions [as others have noted] that slowed the pacing down to a crawl. it felt like not a whole lot happened during the first 200 pages, and what did happen was either incredible vulgar [probably the point and probably meant to 'shock' the reader with its 'brutal honesty'] or did little to ingratiate any of the characters to the reader.  however, what was most frustrating for me was the author continually injecting chinese into the dialogue [or exposition] then immediately translating it into english when the characters are presumably speaking chinese to begin with.  it's the same problem that plagued 'the kite runner.' it drives me nuts. it seems the only reason for this practice is for the author to dazzle the reader with his or her knowledge of a foreign language. whether it's fair or not, i had hard time getting past that and consequently enjoyed the book less than i might have otherwise.

Granted we are talking about a work of fiction her, but really all works of fiction have an element of truth to them...at least the good ones do. Having said that the writer of this novel isn't Chinese (although it sounds like he has spent a lot of time immersed in Chinese culture), but his characters are and a lot of the novel is a description of the Chinese characters reactions to Western Society/Culture.  This being the case, I was scratching my head throughout the novel wondering if this would indeed be their reactions and am I learning anything about the clash between East and West reading this novel.  Granted, as I said before this is a work of fiction, nonetheless, I think it overall if detracted from the impact of the novel (I would expect this is a point that many would disagree with me on).  Having said that, as far as mystery/thrillers/crime novels go, this was a good read.  Oddly enough I found the most interesting character in the book not to be the protagonist Ma Jian, but Ding Ming.  And while the Inspectors plight to find his daughter is certainly an agonizing one, I think it pails in comparison to that of Ding Ming's.  Overall, I think that this is indeed where the novel really succeeds--i.e., in it's portrayal of the plight of illegal immigrants, be they Chinese of otherwise, and the truly awful circumstances they find themselves in search of a better life.  The authors description of the human trafficking is a truly disturbing one; one which gives us a better understanding of the exploitation of illegal immigrants and the perhaps the role we all play in its existence. In that regard, I give the novel 5 stars.",4

Along the way, his story intersects with that of Ding Ming, a mild-mannered, poor migrant whose ability to speak some English helps Inspector Jian navigate the landscape.

I thought I had the book figured out at the beginning of the book.  Certainly, I figured very early that human trafficking was somehow involved.  Imagine my pleasant surprise to be gripped by plot twists and turns and to be totally riveted for the entirety of the story's concluding chapters.  For a reader who reads many mystery novels, Bad Traffic was able to maintain a high level of suspense throughout its pages and deliver its shockers without giving away too much in the beginning of the book.  As such, it was a pretty well crafted story.

Lewis does a fabulous job of generating authenticity with his character's mannerisms, speech, and personalities with regard to their Chinese ethnicity and especially when it comes to the description of an individual set loose in a strange place, no common language, and entirely different cultures.  I imagine that Lewis drew upon his own experience as a traveler in China and Japan (Lewis is also the author of the Rough Guides to China, Beijing, and Shanghai), it is particularly a talent that he can scrutinize his own native land of the United Kingdom from the lens of a middle-aged Chinese man.  This being said, I do have to admit that the writing overall was mediocre and that Lewis's strength is in the plot and not the actual narrative.  Truth be said, I read this book thinking that it would be an absolutely fabulous screenplay, and can totally see a movie made from it.  It seemed like a huge bulk of the novel centered upon what was essentially a long car chase.

A decent read and a humble offering for thriller fans.  I would rate it about 3.5 stars.",4

Inspector Jian is a man of personal and professional stature in his native China.  He receives a desperate call from his daughter, who is supposed to be studying in England, that sending him flying from his world into one completely foreign to him both in custom and language and into a world of smuggled migrants.

This book started so well.  The classic concept of a ""stranger in a strange land"" should have been fascinating.  It's a sad statement when the common element, which proved comforting for Jian, was signs for McDonalds, KFC and Nike.

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for the story waned quickly.  For me, the characters are, for the most part, unlikable.  The protagonist, Jian, is a tough, jaded cop.  Only at the very end do you see some slight humanity and redemption, but it's too little, too late.  The bad guys are very, very bad.  The migrant worker Ding Ming, was the exception but, because of his circumstances, he was such a weak character I lost interest.  Jian's daughter proved the most interesting but we don't come to know about her until near the end of the book.

Although there was a lot of driving around, there was not a strong sense of place.  The book is very violent.  In itself, I can deal with that, but there was nothing to balance or offset it.  I also kept wonderful where the police were.  The lone man of vengeance may make for an exciting plot, but it just didn't quite play for me.

This book may appeal to those who like high-action noir, but I need a little more depth and dimension.",3

Which perhaps also helps to explain why it periodically pops up as the basis for fiction and film, as in this rapid-fire thriller. The twist this book provides is one of perspective -- instead of seeing human smuggling through the eyes of a sympathetic Western law enforcement hero seeking a young Westerner who has disappeared in some exotic locale, we see it through the eyes of a Chinese policeman trying to find his daughter in England. The classic fish-out-of-water device is given fresh life here, simply because we're not used to seeing the West as a foreign land filled with strange signs and cultural cues. But non-English-speaking Chinese cop Ma Jian is almost completely adrift in and around Leeds as he struggles to find a Mandarin speaker to help him.

The hunt for his missing daughter takes place over five action-packed days, pitting him against a cardboard crew of ""snakeheads"" (human traffickers) who bring Chinese into England illegally, and keep them trapped in a life of indentured servitude/slavery. A secondary storyline follows one of these smuggled-in workers as his naive faith in his new life slowly unravels as he in separated from his wife and set to manual labor. He happens to speak some English, which sets him apart from the other Fujian laborers he's placed with, and through a series of misadventures, ends up as the cop's hostage/sidekick. They make a very fun odd couple as they race around the countryside trying to locate the snakeheads. Lewis does a great job presenting their Chinese point-of-view, which has to feel authentic for the book to work. Unfortunately, he also employs an awkward framework that switches between three different narrative viewpoints and several different timelines, making for some confusing reading at times. Other flaws include the villains, who have virtually no depth to them at all, and a plot twist toward the end that pretty much every reader will see coming a mile away.

Still, if you like thrillers, this is a pretty solid one that comes from an interesting perspective. The corrupt Chinese cop makes for an interesting anti-hero, as he is forced to confront his shallowness and culpability in his daughter's peril. And the sidekick is a wonderfully panicky teenager whose confusion over whom to trust is both tragic and comic. The pacing is great, with nonstop momentum and plenty of action interspersed. Probably destined to become a C-grade film starring someone like Jet Li.",4

I laughed. I cried. Well, I laughed, anyway, and kept turning the pages, devouring the words as I went. Christmas Eve Can Kill You is a clever, laugh-out-loud, edge-of-the-seat murder mystery, a first novel from a gifted Canadian author who writes with wicked humor, knife-edge intelligence, and a strong point of view that brings alive the culture and calamities of life above the border in the depressing Winnipeg winter.

Marantz is head and shoulders above the rest in this crowded genre. His eccentric humor and crystal clear prose are what you might get if you crossed Jasper Fford with Michael Chabon. His energetic writing pulls you by the collar through a tangled plot that he deftly untwists. Val Virgo, failed country singer and indifferent talk-show host, is as unforgettable as that screwball friend who used to crack you up in school. Marantz creates heroes who are flawed and bad guys have good parts, and you end up believing them all.

Granted, there are moments when you can lose the thread, but not many and never for long. And for readers south of the Provinces, some of the local color and Canadian references can take a few extra milliseconds to puzzle out. Still, my mouse hovered between a four and a five star rating only because of the weak copy-editing that left a dirty ring of typos around the tub. If you can ignore them, prepare yourself for a great read with a satisfying resolution.

Another reviewer compared it to Dan Brown novels and I sort of agree. All the pieces are here: religious conspiracies, relic hunting, a properly lovable heroine, a love interest that holds its tension through most of the book, and waiting with bated breath to learn how humanity will get on - will we live or die?

I started questioning my own religion and my own knowledge and the gaps in my knowledge. I like that. I like something that makes me really think about what I believe. What seems right to me based on the information available?

Every book, relic, historical figure, etc was something I was able to find more information about on the web. I found some of that information particularly resonant for my own faith research. For that I am grateful.

Why not 5 stars? Like the other Hockney books (his are not alone in this problem) they are amateurishly published, there are some grammatical problems that caused me to need to slow down to figure out what the author actually meant.

Jack was a successful cop. He was respected by his peers and very good at what he did. Then one horrifying event turns his world upside-down, and Jack finds himself as a private eye, peeping into windows for wronged spouses and staring out at the world through the bottom of a whiskey bottle. When he is contacted by a stuffy old solicitor and finds out that an eccentric millionaire has left him a mansion and a few obscure clues to his real past, Jack has to get his act together pretty quickly. With the help of his feisty assistant, Jack frantically works to find out why the people around him tell him he's going to hell and then kill themselves.

This is an entertaining beginning of a series. There isn't really anything new here. We've all read occult stories or seen occult movies. We've all seen the grizzled, alcoholic, washed-up former cop now making a buck as a private investigator.

His current hum drum life of drudgery all changes when he's told that he has inherited a large mansion from a deceased father he never knew existed. This isn't the life Nightingale asked for or ever wished for.

""Your going to hell Nightingale"" or is he. what follows is an unorthodox tale about devil worship and demons from the perspective of an astute cop and non-believer. The story challenges our understanding of right and wrong, while also exploring themes about the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. It also ponders whether who we are is influenced by the environment we grew up in, or is dictated by birth,

Nightingale learns that there is a lot about his past, and his life that was different from what he knew growing up. This well written story was riveting, and had equal parts paranormal and police procedural. Nightingale is a flawed human being with his heart in the right place. he is helped by a secretary, who though young and attractive, is ultimately overqualified for the position she works. Why does she work for me, Nightingale wonders on more than one occasion. Their relationship in this book is one of the more interesting elements of the story. Whether it will evolve into a romance is uncertain, though it is clear they both have feelings for each other. He is also helped by a cop buddy friend from his former life.

I don't want to give too much of the story away, just know that I found Nightingales journey of discovery to be fascinating and the philosophical elements interesting and provocative. It's not just a story about self-discovery, but a journey into the unknown and uncertain. It's also a story that is at times heart-wrenching. Regardless, I look forward to the second book.",5

It had great pacing and an interesting plot that quickly drew me in. I appreciated that while it's a trilogy, I'm not forced by some crazy cliff hanger to read any others if I don't want to. (I do want to though, but I don't feel forced to.) There are twists, but it's not really that kind of thriller... more of a drama/crime/courtroom feel.
The writing was solid, easy to breeze through. Sadly though the characters felt one dimensional, the story line was interesting enough I could look past the flat character development, but it certainly didn't make this a read again.
I'd say this is a 3.5, but the page turning nature rounded it up for me.

Good news: this is an interesting look at religion and how we (as humans) look at the world we live in (or think we live in).

I found this an interesting way to approach the subject he was dealing with, however.  Bad news: it is a little repetitive in some of it's ideas, and his writting style sometimes is a little stilted.  This book leaves you a little unsatisfied with some unanswered questions, which I think may be the point since this appears to be the first of three books.  I suppose the author will wrap everything up in the third book, but I hate when authors do that.  There are a number of questions that come to mind when you read this (why in the world is this going on?  why is this happening? etc), not least of which is the question of self-determination vs pre-ordained fate, where does personal choice come in, and why would someone be held to a ""contract"" that they (personally) were never involved in negotiating?

Drinking, smoking and in debt, he agrees to meet a lawyer at the lawyer's office believing it's for a case.  Jack quickly learns that he'd been adopted, his biological father died and left him a large estate with a mansion, and on his 33rd birthday in 3 weeks, a devil is coming to claim his soul.

The intensity is there, but the pace is really slow and I actually set it aside a couple of times.  It was difficult for me to feel for Jack because I just couldn't get into Jack's head.  He just soldiers on without much in the way of emotion.  It's a decent book but I can't see myself reading the rest of the trilogy.",2

First, Jack Nightingale may or may not have killed a man, so his police career is over and replaced by a pretty shabby career as a private detective. Then, random people start telling him that, ""You are going to hell, Jack..."" Then at age 32 he finds out he was adopted, which was bad enough until he finds out who his birthfather was. And as if that is not enough, he finds out that his birth father sold his soul to a devil, who is coming in a couple of weeks to collect.

Wow, that could really keep you from looking forward to your birthday.

In the novel, Jack has to face the unexpected and then the unlikely. In fact, a fair amount seems to be simple insanity. As he finds out more, though, he also realizes that he had better be ready for anything--much of that insanity is starting to sound all too likely.

Stephen Leather introduces us in this book to a protagonist who is a good man to know, but who has to face a personal crisis beyond anything he has already faced. How he meets this crisis makes it clear that he is would be a good person to have on your side. The question is whether just being a good person is enough to get out of ""You are going to hell, Jack...""",2

Barely making enough to scrape by and keep himself in cigarettes, he is dumbfounded to learn that he has inherited a huge mansion from a man claiming to be his father, and although the property is heavily in debt, he finds a secret stash of creepy but priceless books dealing with witchcraft and Satanism.

His alleged father also leaves him a DVD message which says in effect - Sorry old chap, but I kinda sold your soul to a devil when you were born, and hey, your time is almost up.  Obviously this isn't the sort of message one wants to get from one's father, but to make it worse, people he needs help from start dying in mysterious and terrible ways, and he repeatedly gets the message that he's on the way to hell.

Torn by disbelief and after lots of theological soul-searching, he begins to seek the knowledge hidden in the library, but will he be able to resolve his problem before his number comes up?

A fast paced and exciting read, this imperfect detective is a wonderfully compelling protagonist in what promises to be a spookily cool series.

I'm a fan of thrillers and police procedural novels and the book description intrigued me.  I found much to like about the storytelling and much to dislike as well, so the book rates a solid 3 stars in my opinion.

NEGATIVES:
* Some significant story elements disappeared...and would've been a powerful player.  Without giving too much away, what about the firefighter's case? Will he see justice? Also...it's implied wife's death may have had something to do with *this* case...but it's never evaluated nor properly addressed.
* Very shallow point of view: We're in Alex's head and know he had what he calls 'an affair' after his wife's death...but when it's revealed *who* the 'affair' was with, it's a rip off.  The reader should've known at least a hint more far earlier than that bomb was dropped.
* Chronic use of weak verbs, abundant misuse of grammar (dialogue excluded), etc.

POSITIVES:
* The ending had some serious tension as everything unfolded
* Apparently the police procedural elements and DNA testing elements are accurate--the author did his research
* I enjoyed it enough to finish it.

This was a really good story! I fell in love with Tory and Rye and their story was surprisingly good and a freebie to boot (and it's still free on Amazon).

Tory is a cook who's working her way through school. She's currently finishing up her dissertation for a doctorate in Anthropology. She lost her parents due to a car wreck at an early age and was raised by her grandparents. Tory's grandmother taught her how to cook but made her promise (on her deathbed) that she'd get an education (hence the doctorate). Tory's grandfather just died recently, leaving her on her own and with a lot of medical bills to deal with.

Rye is a Country star. He grew up in a blue blood southern family and got disowned when he left law school to pursue his dreams of singing country for a living. Rye is a bad boy and tends to party and sleep around.

The story begins with Rye being on tour and looking for a good meal late at night after he finishes with a show. He lost his last cook and found great reviews for a local diner so he shows up to get a meal. He finds that the food is awesome and that the cook is having money problems so he offers her (Tory) a position as his tour cook for an amount of money that will really help ease some of her pressing bills. Tory doesn't listen to country so she's not really a fan of Rye's. She's not sure if she really wants to be his tour cook but takes a chance since she could really use the money and has the summer off of school anyways. Since Rye lost his last cook after some sleeping around made her get pissed and leave, Rye makes it a condition of Tory's employment that she can't sleep with anyone on tour. Tory goes along with this because she's not the sort to sleep around and doesn't really see it as a possible issue.

When things start up, Rye and Tory have some conflicts between them due to some publicity/tabloid stories (both good and bad) that cause some difficulties. Before too long though, Rye and Tory become friends, finding that they like chatting and having each other as company. When Rye's family issue become more pressing, he turns to Tory for support and this pushes them closer. Rye hasn't seen himself as having anything to offer a woman and therefor can't see himself getting seriously involved or married to a woman and Tory sees his reluctance in this area clearly. She's not willing to get her heart broken but things end up pushing them together and eventually they both let themselves go there. Things aren't perfect after that though and both external and internal issues end up causing drama that pulls them apart. Things look pretty bad for a while but Rye grows as a person and eventually realizes he can't live without Tory. He makes a great effort to get her back and although Tory was pretty positive things were done between them, she can't help but be touched by his actions and they're able to come back together in a very sweet HEA.

I was very pleased with this story. I really liked both Tory and Rye. Tory was sweet and smart with a backbone as well. I liked that although she was sweet, that sweetness didn't come across as weak. Rye had his issues but the story showed enough of him under the bluster that you could see he was really a great guy underneath, he just had to see it for himself to realize he had something to offer the right woman. I also really liked his relatives (except his mother), especially his niece and nephew. Overall, this was a really good story with some very likable characters I'd recommend it (especially since it's a freebie). :D",4

Second, the vocabulary in general is extremely basic.  Things like colors and numbers, while important, are hardly worth buying a book for.

Finally, the design is cartoonish -- more like a child's coloring book than something that would appeal to most adults.

To me the battery life is long-lasting but, like another reviewer said, I am noticing after having it a while (and using it again) that the neck seems to loosen up or something over time and the light falls a little bit to the side. This gets annoying because I feel like I'm constantly adjusting it every few lines if I'm reading in bed (my bedroom light is ambient lighting so not bright enough to read by, hence my book light needs to do a good job illuminating the whole page). I also don't really like that it'll only light up one page at a time so I have to move it back and forth after each sides page is finished. I think this adds to the constant adjustment because then 'swivel' it over to the other page and as soon as I let go the light falls a little further to the side, so I move it back, and it falls a little, so I adjust the neck (bend it in a way to keep it's form better) and it only lights up the top of the page... etc.

I'm on here today to look for a second book light; one that is big enough to light up both pages without being over cumbersome and one that has a little stiffer neck.",2

It does what you expect it to do. Volume control and mute works fine. Call buttons don't work for me but I don't care about that. I'll probably use this for a little bit then upgrade when better options are available.

What I like:
* Simple setup. USB plug and play
* Mute button works

What I don't think:
* Feels super cheap cheap cheap. Low quality plastic.
* Buttons make loud clicking sound when you press them.
* Buttons are in bad positions. When you press the buttons the whole unit tips over.

Overall:

The good news is it was only $2.30 and lasted 3 years so no real loss.  Now that I'm in the market for a replacement, I noticed that the price went up quite a bit.  I might consider this again for $2.30 (since it's probably worth that), but with so many other cheap car chargers on Amazon right now, why get this one?",2

Pros:
-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.
-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.
-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.
-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.
-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.
-Pretty solid construction.
-It cost less than $2.

Cons:
-It died on me after 3 months.

I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.

After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.

For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",2

I had first gotten this keyboard cover a while back and absolutely loved it. It fit perfectly and protected the keys from dust, etc.  It was definitely easier to type with it on the keyboard, my fingers gripped better.

But after a while, it started poking up a little in the middle of the cover, so I ordered a couple more covers from the same seller.

The first shipment sent the wrong covers, for different keyboard.  I informed the seller, and he was great -- told me to keep those and sent me a new pair.

The new covers fit the keyboard, but the outer edges of the cover are essentially gone - cut almost up against the keys.  Which means that the cover no longer goes down to the keyboard.  Any dust, dirt, etc. will get to the keyboard around the edges.

The original, first cover I'd gotten from this seller is like the covers that are pictured.  It has wider outer edges that reach the keyboard and prevents any dust or debris from getting to the keyboard.  These new covers are essentially useless since they no longer protect the keyboard.

I'll revise my review if I learn/see that the covers have gone back to the old design that actually does the job.",5

When I got, I was rather surprised how well it worked.  While it's plug 'n play, I decided to forgo the install CD and just downloaded the drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.  While the video is decent quality, it still retains some grainyness after burning the video to a DVD, the quality of the original played on a VCR is still better quality than what you capture and burn to a DVD.  That being said, it's not all that bad, really.  But since I only needed to copy a few home videos that we made from an old VHS-C camcorder it wasn't really worth it.

I found that the best way to get the best quality was to adjust the video settings manually (add a little more saturation, and sharpness), and use the ""DVD"" format for capture, that were there is minimal second encoding required when you burn to a disc (I use windows DVD maker, because I'm cheap :B)

The nice thing is it also includes an S-video option, unfortunately my VCR only allows S-video with 480p signals (ie DVD movies and restricts VCR video to 480i.

Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:

>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.

>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the ""breaking in"" of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).

I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.",6

A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right.  I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed.  If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold.

At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.

I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.

Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1"" mark in terms of thickness.

What did I like:
-Construction quality, very nicely made.
-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.
-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.
-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.

My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.

First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.

Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.

Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.

Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.

Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.

All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.

I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..

--UPDATE 12/9/2010--
I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marware-Eco-Vue-for-iPad/dp/B003C1CCJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marware Eco-Vue for iPad</a>.

First off, it's just TOO DARN BRIGHT.  This lights up the entire room and keeps anyone who may be sleeping near you awake.  The lights aren't directional, so they just glow brightly and spill light everywhere.  There's no dimmer, so the ultra-bright LEDs make it like daytime wherever you are.  Not appropriate at all for travel on a bus or plane.

Second, it attaches by using a couple of bendable wires wrapped in smooth plastic.  This means you get no grip on the actual book or surface, and you end up having to hold it with your hand.

Also, there are 3 suction cups and I had a challenge getting all of them to stick on my windshield over the winter. It seemed like there was always one of them that let loose.

Installation was slightly complicated by the fact that the instructions were mostly in an Asian language, but assembly was simple enough that it wasn't much of an obstacle.  The monitor is *BEAUTIFUL* !!!!!!!!!!!

I truly hope that I don't have the reliability problems that others have reported after 1 year, but for now I *love* it...

Later note, September 2015 (6 months after purchase):
Well, it remains a gorgeous monitor when it decides to work, but I've had to retire it.  When it's running, it runs beautifully, but I have *endless* headaches whenever I need to reboot the monitor - in most cases, the monitor just does not turn on.  I can usually get it to turn on by repeatedly unplugging the video cable, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in.  Using the power switch has no effect.

I have tried three different video cards (GTX 670, GTX 780, GTX 970), and all have the same issue with it.  I have upgraded BIOS on my motherboard, upgraded BIOS on all three video cards, made sure Nvidia drivers were current, but nothing changes this situation.  Furthermore, it is getting worse; at first, I only had to unplug/replug video cable once, but after awhile it took two repluggings, more recently even three or four were required.

This became a much more serious issue recently; I was researching why our electrical bill was so high, and discovered that when my computer was in idle mode (video and disk drive off), my gaming computer was still pulling 190W !!!  So, I changed the machine to go into Sleep mode after awhile; this mostly powers down the computer, and it draws around 40W in this mode, and can be re-awakened with a mouse click - except for this monitor, which does not wake up at all, until I do the unplug/replug trick a few times.

So, I got a nice 6 months, and definitely love the display, but I am done with it.  Given all the other problems that have been reported here on this monitor, I'm not going to put effort into repairing or replacing it.  I'll just learn from experience and move on.

So generally, just Beware - the monitor definitely has quality issues.",3

I'm a software developer, but also do some amateur photography.  I have two PC's and two Mac Mini's.  My previous monitor had three dual link DVI inputs.  Trying to find a monitor to support inputs from three or four computers at full resolution was difficult, so I ultimately opted to purchase an IOGEAR 4-Port Dual-Link DVI KVMP Pro switch to switch the video (and keyboard and mouse) externally.  This allowed me to get the most cost effective panel for my needs without paying for all the extra internal switching circuitry.  This Yamakasi fit the bill perfectly.  Now, not only is the switching external, but the monitor power supply is external as well, so if anything fails I can replace the individual piece without shelling out over $1,000 for a whole the monitor.

I was concerned about reports of the hot power supply, but the one I received is marked for US with a 7 AMP rating.  It did get pretty warm when first testing out the monitor at full brightness, but when I dialed the brightness back to a non-suntanning level, the power brick cooled off considerably.

I did indeed receive a panel with zero dead or stuck pixels... always a joy.

I did a custom calibration on my Windows and Mac machines with the standard monitor calibration widgets and everything looks just lovely in all the desktop and graphics applications I use.

I ended up losing it one day, and found the unit about three months later in the driveway, a little scuffed up, but it worked fine, so I took a push pin and heated it up, and put a hole through it and put a paper clip through it and wrapped it into a ring, and clipped it onto my keyring with a standard clip, pretty determined to keep this thing, because I really liked it.

Worked good for a few weeks, but the plastic was too soft to hold, and it ended up breaking through. In the end, I'm just going to use the unit at home, but while it was still portable, it was really nice. I'm giving it a 4/5 because for what it's supposed to do, it works great.",5

Using 2 of these so far no issues reported.","I am writing a review on the behalf of myself, though we purchased it under our company's Amazon's account.

First, we only use two of these for our label printers, the Zebra ZP 500 Plus which we use for FedEx and the Zebra ZP 450 which is what we use for UPS and for Labelright label program.

This was simple to set up. We already had the driver installed on the computer, which made this much easier. Sometimes, some Zebra drivers will allow you to add the drivers without adding the printer. Othertimes, you can add the driver if you are installing it via USB. Because we already had the driver already installed in the computer locally, used the supplied cd's software to find the print server. From there we changed the IP, kept the subnet, and changed the IP of the gateway to what we use for our network.

From here, I did choose my printer, but it would not print. Instead, I removed the printer. Added a new printer via IP address I had already set, and choose to keep the same driver I was using for that device before. Then the prints worked fine.

You may need to be a little tech savvy to get it working. Not everything works perfectly as the instructions say, but once you get it, it seems to work well so far. The purpose for us doing this, was to prevent us from having to move the printer from one computer to another especially if a computer goes down. Now, we don't have to.",7

(But You Should Buy Something Else.)","I bought this device to be used with a Brother Intellifax 2820 (via USB) that was located near my internet modem/router (via ethernet cable).

1. First of all, the item does not come with any of these cables (USB or ethernet), so hopefully you already have some. The only things in the box were the print server, the power cable, and a mini-CD for installation software.

2. You may also want to install the printer drivers on your computer (by directly connecting it to your computer via USB cable) before you get started, if you don't have it on there already.

3. Anyway, I connected the device according to the instructions, and the software on the CD never located the print server on the network. So I downloaded software from their website (there were 3 of them: a management utility, a setup wizard, and something called ""PSWizard LPR."" I tried all three of those, and only the last one worked. (Oddly, they all looked the same, but only one located the print server on the network.)

So as you can see, this entire thing took a few hours.

4. The instructions also recommend that you use the default IP, but after trying that for a while, I finally figured out that you had to use DHCP (let your router assign the IP address for this device.)

5. The next problem is that the link they provide to configure/manage your software (www.tplinklogin.net) doesn't work, either. It's some website with no content, labeled ""buy this domain.""

In the end, after hours of trial and error, I got the device installed, and it worked well from my computer. But then, I tried to use Google Cloud Print and print from my phone and tablet, and it was very buggy. It worked sometimes, didn't work sometimes.

Bottom line: It works. But it was very difficult to setup, and its performance was spotty when using Google Cloud Print.

So I ended up buying something else. It cost just a few bucks more, and it works great and the setup is easy: the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TP-LINK-TL-WDR3500-Wireless-N600-Dual-Band-Router/dp/B0098QV038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 Wireless N600 Dual Band Router</a>. The management software is pretty good, and I figured everything out in about 15 minutes. And it prints very well with Google Cloud Print.

One of the biggest differences with the router with a built-in print server and the lone print server is that you can configure the router by directly plugging your computer into it (via an ethernet cable) - but a print server needs to be found on the network - and that took a long time for me.

And I think the reason there aren't many print servers to choose from now is because it's just better to buy a router with a USB port that has print server capabilities built-in. That might be why the manufacturer's support for this device is iffy (e.g., the device management website is a dead link.) I wish I knew that before I wasted time on this device.

Its only advantage over a router is that it is much smaller. So if you really don't have room for a router, and you just want a simple setup, you have some patience, and no real need for reliable printing from mobile devices - this isn't a terrible device. But I personally wouldn't buy it again. In the same situation, I would prefer the router with the print server capabilities.",4

Unfortunately, we can only print from the  PC that I used to originally configure the print server.  The other PC's on the network cannot see the printer attached to the print server.

I give this device two stars because it will work after a fashion.  Their technical support is none existent even though they claim that support is available 24/7.  Bull.

The second problem is this card was brittle. So brittle in fact, it broke in my fingers while trying to wipe the contacts clean when the computer decided the card was corrupted and would not read. I don't know if this is a widespread issue but I've never had a card break in my fingers like this, SanDisk or any other brand.

Cutting to the chase - I'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback.  Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue.  But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable.  Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.

So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine.  I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.

Maxell 191018 Audio Tape Head Cleaner (Wet)

A cassette deck can be cleaned two ways.  The Maxell 19 10 18 offers the quicker approach (It will not give you the results of the more time consuming).  The labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck (For the units that allow this) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid.

If you want faster results, Maxell has done almost all the work for us.  The cleaner looks like a standard cassette.  The instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck.  Presto that is it!

As always, try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment.  Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.

Enjoy the music and be well,

My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV. Recorded audio sounds fine.

Cheapo decks that do not have this feature may work fine with these tapes. I've had no problem with other, commercially available cassettes on this deck.

My advice, if you have these tapes, is to run them a bit before you record to them. Pop 'em in your deck and fast forward the entire tape, then rewind fully. Maybe a few times. With one tape, after recording one side just fine it was stopping every 3 seconds no matter where I started from on the opposite side, until I performed the above. YMMV. Recorded audio sounds fine.

I would add that these are recommended in the Nakamichi owner's manual. Go figure.",6

See the link from the commenter below, and also try musicians friend. Don't buy this aged overstock overpriced junk!

We who still love the warm sound that only analog provides and are still die hard, DIY recorders using analog 4tracks are forced to pay ridiculous prices for OLD overstock hi-bias tapes from the 90s since the only brand name cassettes you can buy at a store like Walgreens is a 5 pack cheapo Maxell normal bias (even these are being hard to come by). This is the case with Amazon and eBay - all I can find are overpriced overstock still sealed high bias cassettes for five bucks each plus shipping - Neither TDK nor Maxell make Hi-Bias anymore so all we have is old leftover stock and these sellers exploit that fact. I'm not sure if the cassettes lose any of their quality after a certain amount of time (please comment if someone knows), but regardless, I don't recall paying these prices when they were new!

I don't know if anyone manufactures new Hi-Bias tapes... if anyone knows, please comment... Anyway, this is very discouraging. A home made tape was a labor of love and a sound you cannot get from digital. I still am a die hard analog DIY recorder, and I use an 8 channel analog Tascam 4track, one of the best models of 4 tracks made, using Shure studio mics, and I often master to a CD burner, not a PC (depending on what I'm working with). The tracks only become mp3s when I rip the master CD into the computer. It has become increasingly harder to do this because of this. Now I use my 4track mostly to record solo recordings but I have used it to record full band demos and have been able to produce near professional quality recordings! Sublime's ""Robbin' in the Hood"" was recorded entirely on an analog 4track, as have others.
Doubtful, but any sellers reading this? Your 10-15 year old overstock hi-bias tapes aren't gold, jerks.",2

I've used them on a Nakamichi 581 cassette deck, a Tandberg TCD320 cassette deck, and small hand-held recorders from Sony (with built-in microphone).

I've used the Maxell XLII tapes for recording albums from vinyl, recording from compact discs, and recording live, e.g., parties, waterfalls, and my own electric-guitar playing using a Nakamichi microphone.

When I first got my Nakamichi 581, I did a side-by-side test of an actual vinyl record, and my taped copy of the vinyl recording.  I was not able to tell the difference.  This demonstrates the high quality of the Maxell XLII tape.  The particular recording was a duet with Max Roach on drums and Anthony Braxton on saxophone.  This recording was an especial challenge to the tape's ability to record at higher frequencies.  The Maxell tape passed the test, so to speak.  Also, I recently listened to recordings that I made in the year 1980.  I have no reason to believe that the recordings on my Maxell tape have deteriorated.  This is another good thing about the Maxell XLII tape.

I have nothing bad to say about the 90 minute Maxell XLII tape.

But I do have bad things to say about tape recorders.  First of all, my Tandberg is a risky machine.  Perhaps, one time out of 100 times that I use the Tandberg, the tape gets tangled up.  I blame this on the Tandberg, not on the tape.  Another problem is that my Nakamichi 581 has been broken for many years, and I have not been able to find anybody who repairs this sort of machine.  The Nakamichi 581 was, and probably still is, the highest quality cassette deck known to mankind.  But I can't find anybody who can fix mine.  Again, this is not the fault of the tape.

Finally, Sony had an excellent little hand-held cassette player/recorder, the TCM-454VK.  The sound quality of this machine is fine for recording nature sounds and children's music concerts.  However, I dropped this Sony machine, and it broke, and it is not manufactured anymore.  Instead, Sony does make a similar, newer model, but the sound quality of this Sony cassette recorder is garbage (please see my reviews of the newer Sony machine).  But this is not the fault of the tape. Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder adds a high-pitched whining sound to your tapes.  A similar recorder, the Panasonic RQ-L31 Portable Cassette Recorder with Slide Microphone, adds a high-pitched chirping sound to your tapes.

The following applies only to recording nature sounds, children's marching bands, and so on.  The following does not apply to making tape recordings from commercially available music on compact discs.

Last year, I bought a digital voice recorder, the Olympus DS-40.  Please see my review of the Olympus DS-40.  The Olympus DS-40 is an absolute dream and a miracle  -- because of the very low background noise, because of the absence of clicking sounds when starting/stopping or when pausing/restarting recordings, because of the extreme length of recordability, and because of its extremely compact size.  Therefore, at least for amateur recordings of nature sounds, marching bands, and parties, cassette tapes and cassette recorders might no longer be medium of choice.",2

We have one rather-new VCR left (after having had many), and I was using it to copy our old, important family tapes onto a hard drive to digitize them, make DVDs, and have them in a permanent medium. I got about halfway through when I was noticing the streaking of dirty heads. Not having any of our old head cleaning tapes left, I ordered this one from a company I used to trust for what I expected to be a one-time use. This is an S-VHS machine and the four tapes I was copying are a mix of S-VHS and regular VHS.

Upon receiving this cleaner (late-even using Prime) I found a pretty cheaply made cassette with a Maxell sticker on it (shame on you for using such a cheap supplier). You put in some drops of the liquid and run for 30 seconds. After doing that I put back in the tape I was copying-and got nothing but snow. I tried a couple tapes, even one's I had just copied, nothing. They are now unwatchable on this machine.

Looking more closely at the cleaning cassette, I find it only has a very short stretch of cleaning tape. And the spool it's on is very loose in the housing, it wouldn't rewind in the machine (again, a very reliable machine without a lot of use). I tried rewinding by hand and it was very stiff and hard to do. But I figured I have nothing to loose and tried it again. It wouldn't even run for more than 10 seconds.

I now need to find another machine to finish copying my tapes. This will cost me much more than the $10 this **** cleaner did!",2

First out of the box, and compared to the Cobys, they sounded AWFUL.  Tinny, the noise blended together, and generally terrible.

I've since kept wearing them since they're all I have, and I will admit that they seem to have gotten better for me.  Maybe they've just broken me.

These are NOT high-quality sound headphones.  The sound tends to be muddled together, even after they break in, and I already lost the pathetic rings of rubber that surround these.  How they could manage to fall off is anyone's guess, but they did, and that reduces the comfort of the headphones considerably.  Furthermore, since they don't fit into your ear properly, the sound is quite ""tinny"", and they tend to fall out whenever I walk to classes.

Also, move the jack while listening and the sound will crackle/disappear for a few seconds until you get it back.  That may just be my mp3 player slowly dying, though.

Still, they work, and I can hear a reasonable range of sounds from them.  About as much as you can expect from $5.

Overall, buy these if you are desperate for headphones and on a severe budget crunch.  Otherwise, do what I'm doing right after writing this review, and fish out a bit of extra money for actual high-quality headphones.",4

(I also ran this CD lens cleaner a few times through my five year old PC's CD player.)  After running this lens cleaner (numerous times) through both my car's and my PC's CD player I noted NO difference in player performance.

EDIT: After further consideration I came back to edit my two star review.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  If, I say IF, you are considering buying this consider two things: 1) all the ""great"" reviews are eight years old and 2) there is a reason this item, eight years ago, sold for $20+ and now it's selling for $3.

In comparison to 2 other Wet Cleaner brands I have at home, Maxell did the worst job. It cleaned the Head, but I had to re-use this Cleaner too frequently. The duration between cleanings was annoying & irritating.

We were able to view 1 VHS Tape, directly after Cleaning. But, in order to watch another movie, I had to Chean the Head again, which was much too soon. In the past, after using other Wet VHS Head Cleaners, we were able to view at least 6 or 7 movies, in-between cleanings. Therefore, something is defective, either the solution, or the Cleaner Tape.

To test this product, we wanted to see if we could view at least 1 more movie, without any problems. Therefore, I used the VHS Tape, but replaced the solution with rubbing alcohol. Believe it or not, it worked. We watched a second movie, and my VHS movie tape was not destroyed, because I've used it several times after this procedure.

Conclusion: I'm going to try the Dry VHS Head Cleaners in the future. When desperate for a movie in the mean-time, I'll repeat the same procedure, using my own solution.

Radio still works (though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception)and the clock is still really hard to see.  It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud.  Husband tried to fix it but couldn't do it.  Seven years is pretty good, I guess. I don't see anything better on Amazon, at least for this price, so I will probably purchase another of the same.  Something I did not mention in my original review:  the batteries seem to last forever.  Same number of stars for the same reasons.

Original Review: This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read.  I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there.  If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame.  There is no back light which adds to the difficulty.  I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you.  If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you.",4

It still works fine, although the material covering the on/off button has worn completely off. Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a ""shower radio,"" this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).

The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.

The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this. I have to crank it fairly high to hear when I'm taking a shower (even though it's waterproof, I don't put in the shower with me). However, there's not distortion at high volume.

I cannot say anything about the battery life yet, but overall I'm very satisfied with the radio.",2

However one thing that isn't good, and I don't know if anyone else has had this - a few of the tops of the push buttons have peeled off. Right now the off button has no top, so there's a hole with the mechanics of that button showing. Prior to today, in order to turn it off, I would push inside the button. However, now that has ceased to work and the only way to turn it off is to remove the batteries. Someone had mentioned to me that the tops should be glossed with colorless nail polish but this suggestion was made to me AFTER the tops came off. I don't think that I was overly harsh with this - just normal use so I really don't understand why this should have happened.  This is more of a cosmetic problem than performance.  I will say that even with this, I intend to buy the radio again because of any small radio I've had, this is by far so superior in looks and sound and design. Maybe Sony has made improvements to this - I can't believe I'm the only one to whom this has happened. It's lasted a very long time - maybe 10 years or so. Although I'd rather not have to spend money for another radio, all in all, it's really worth it. We don't keep it in the shower, but on a shelf away from water. Maybe that's why it's lasted so long.  Next one I get I think I'll try the nail polish trick and see if that helps.",4

I let it dry out again and put it on a self over the sink in the bathroom where it would never get wet but apparently the steam condensed inside it because there was water in it again (I could see tiny little drops on the inside of the display).

I've been very happy with my Pentax IQZoom90WR for six years and I wanted to see if the 370z could replace it for most situations. LENS QUALITY:  Indistinguishable except in HDTV mode at small focal lengths where  curvature is noticable at the sides. Still acceptable. RESOLUTION:  Indistinguishable on 4x6/4x7 prints at ASA 100 and 200. Lack of precise  definition of edges with ASA 400 but still acceptable. If you want to blow  up the photo to 8x10, you'll want to use ASA 100 and that will limit you to  bright light situations. If I decide to do night photography outdoors (like  the Disneyland parade), I'll switch back to my 35mm using ASA 400. (I  should note however that the 370z performed well. I'm just a bit of a  perfectionist.) RED-EYE REDUCTION: Not as effective as my Pentax IQZ90WR.  Based on the shots I've taken, red-eye occurs in 10-15% of my face-on flash  shots. The occurence with my Pentax is less than 1% but it does use a  pre-flash whereas the 370z uses a mini-lamp. PORTABILITY: Excellent! Put it  into its case and strap it to your belt and you won't know it's there. This  is a BIG plus of the 370z since it allows you to enjoy your environment as  well as be a photographer. The worst shot in the world is the one you  didn't take because you didn't have your camera with you. FOCAL LENGTHS:  Comparable but the 370z is a step-zoom whereas my 35mm has a continuous  zoom. This is not much of a problem since you'll rarely encounter a  situation that requires absoultely precise framing with a zoom. FRAME  FORMATS: Panoramic mode shows too much grain at ASAs 200 and above.  Thankfully there's ...MID-ROLL CARTRIDGE CHANGE: Excellent feature! Allowed  me to switch to ASA400 at night and ASA100 when the sun was bright.  WISHLIST ITEM: If only it were weather-resistant or splash-proof. SUMMARY:  It's replaced my 35mm point-and-shoot for documenting my family's vacations  and daily activities but I still keep my 35mm in a suitcase or the car for  rainy days, special night shots, or situations where I might want a photo  blown-up to 8x10. This camera is well designed for its target market; the  average photographer who wants to capture day-to-day shots.",5

Other family menbers have had a series of 35mm Point-and-shoots, but the 370Z is better.  Reliable (at least for me), simple to use, with a zoom range that goes from true wide-angle (most don't) to portrait-length telephoto (the regular ELPH doesn't).  I still have my 35mm SLRs and 7 lenses for ""serious"" photography, but it sure is easier to carry the ELPH 370.",4

I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to.

I wanted them to limit outside noise while not leaking the sound out to outsiders either, as I need them for practicing piano without disturbing my roommates.  This is why the closed-back design seemed favorable.
In reading reviews of other headphones while trying to make my selection, I found that a major problem with closed-back designs is that the sound resonates and distorts, making it sound like tin cans over your ears.
There is no exepction with these.  When I tried playing my keyboard through them, they sounded way worse than any headphones or ear buds I had ever used with it.
To their credit, keyboard voices other than piano sounded a little better, so maybe these headphones would be great for listening to techno music or something, but certainly not classical.

I bought the radio on the chance it was old stock since GE stopped manufacturing this model in 2008 but was very disappointed with the RCA 7887 that I received. The radio was sent back to EW and they were given one-star for falsely misleading the radio as a GE product. EW e-mailed a response stating that the radio was the same as the GE but having done my homework, found this model has gone through at least two versions changes in the last three years since RCA placed it's brand on it and in each case the quality became poorer and poorer.

I own a RCA 7887 and it's o.k. but don't pay more than $35.00 due to the poor costruction or the possibilty of getting one that's DOA. I went through 5 units until I found one that worked to my satisfaction. Thank you to Amazon that took back all those radios and were kind enough to exchange them until I found one that suited me. Problems with the 7887 ranged from drift and poor dxing reception, to faulty installation of knobs. All the radios required time to warm up before they produced any sound and reminded me of my first tube receiver.

If you are looking for a large field radio, Grundig's 450dlx is fair but will run between $80-100. Tecsun makes great small radios with DSP and cost a fraction of the Grundig line but they are all very small. I will also mention Grundig's other field radio, the 350dx, but at a cost of $80 it also has the same station drift that rivals the RCA 7887. With China becoming better at producing electronics, it won't be long before we will have a field radio with DSP and then many of the problems that exsist with all the models will disappear.",4

Don't throw it down the stairs then.  Just put it where you want it and enjoy it.  Now that I've got mine set up where it can pick up stations and I've got the volume and tone set the way I want, all I do with the controls is switch between the same two stations on occasion.  So I suspect this radio will last a while.

These radios are especially useful if your home office is partially or completely below ground, like in a finished basement.  Or, if you work in a metal framed office building and you want to listen to talk radio.

AM signals are directional.  You need to find the location of the transmitting tower for the station you want to listen to, and then point the radio toward the tower.  That's what I did and I can listen to radio in a place where nobody else can.

It's also a good general purpose portable radio for sitting out on your deck listening to the game or music or whatever.  It's not as bulky as a ""boom box"" but it's got better speakers than most portable radios, so it just sounds better in return for a slightly higher price.

Postscript:  In all fairness to those who comment on the build quality, I will say that my radio stays in one place tuned to one channel and maybe tuned to a second channel on occasion.  I hardly adjust the controls at all.  So, maybe those who are complaining about the construction quality have a point.  I'm just not using this radio in a way that involves moving it or manipulating the controls much.  It has a very easy life.",7

I'm considering buying bose--and I hate bose.,"These are pretty ""meh"" noise canceling headphones when they work.  They kinda block some noise, and kinda cancel some.  Thats about it.  Nothing special, nothing to write home about.

Mine didn't last 4 days.  They still play music much quieter than before and with no noise canceling.  I don't want uncomfortable, unfashionable, someone large and bad sounding headphones, so there's really no point in keeping them.  They did get me through a weekend of studying, and I think I did pretty well on my 2 exams.  This means that noise cancel headphones are probably a good option for me.

These headphones feel cheap--like they're going to break, and its no surprise that they did.  The battery compartment is in the awkward 6 foot cable (which I don't like, usually makes a large thud when it hits you as you walk) And what good is a 6 foot cable?  Its just long enough to trip on, and too long to put in a pocket, and way too short for home stereo use.  Just an example of the build quality: if you open the battery compartment, there's nothing shielding the circuit board for the battery, no plastic covering it.  You literally put the batteries against the board.  It's cutting corners and it'll break in the long run.

The earcups swivel so you can DJ?  I'd rather DJ in earbuds honestly; better isolation and sound.  They also fold up, but the exposed wiring looks like it will break if you fold it up repeatedly.

Sound quality:  They have dirty-over emphasized mids.  Basically if you boost the treble and bass significantly, you might not notice how bad they sound.  On a side note, they actually appear to have a soundstage.  Weird right?  They might actually use angled drivers, I don't know, and I can't open them to find out.  The earpads are glue/taped to the sides.

In summary, NO.  Don't do it.  If you're going to cheap out, go buy the sony's instead.",6

I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with ""D"" batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:

1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.

2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a ""DX Machine"", both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.

3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.

On the plus side:

1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds

2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio

3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.

Unfortunately the set I put on cost nearly $200 and was sold out.  The following day, I saw these while I was grocery shopping in a Wal-Mart and thought I should give them a chance.

Opening the package, I instantly noticed the cheap materials this product was made from.  The cord was too thin, the battery compartment had a snap closure that poorly fit, and the fabric over the cans was misaligned and had over-cut hanging out.

Turning on the noise cancellation was just as disappointing.  I immediately heard a hissing through the headphones, and barely noticed any reduction of background sound (a movie on TV).  I flipped the switch on and off to see if I could notice any reduction, and after a few minutes of testing, I discovered even their effective noise cancellation was 0-30% at the most.  My big can headphones with passive cancellation performed this well, and the sound quality is significantly better.  I took them back the as soon as I could.

I recommend you do not purchase this product, and not to purchase any noise cancellation product without trying it first hand or making sure the store has an excellent return policy.",3

The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.

The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.

Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.

In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.

I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.  If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.",2

Plusses:

(1)  Selectivity and sensitivity are excellent, and comparable to the Tivoli PAL (which costs over $100).

(2)  The sound quality for the spoken word is quite adequate.

Minuses:

Note that to me the only significant Minus is #1.

(1)  The III's reproduction of music is poor-to-unacceptable.  I've even tried playing music through up to eight IIIs (yes, eight!) to see if the lack of musical sound quality was due to simple lack of amplification; it's not.

(2)  Both IIIs that have stopped working for me did so because the on-off (silver) button while appearing to be in the down-on position in fact wasn't low enough to turn the III on.  Fortunately one can solve this problem by wedging a dime between the button and the case.

(3)  Should you try to tune to the same station using multiple IIIs at the same time (as I do), there's a noticeable variation between IIIs in where on the dial that same station appears.

Considerations:

(1)  Sounds best when both bass and treble are at halfway on (that is, if the control were numbered from 1 to 10, it would be at 5).

(2)  The bass control adds more distortion that bass.

(3)  The headphone jack takes a stereo (mini) plug (even though not surprisingly the sound through the headphones is monaural), which I consider to preferable to a monaural jack, because effectively all headphones have stereo plugs.

(4)  According the the User's Manual, that Normal-Wide button works only on AM, not FM.",6

If you use them at a desk and move much, you'll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it'll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones.  The Sonys only used a single AAA battery but the Maxells use two.  So, Sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation.  Oddly, the Sonys seem to have much better battery life for me.  The Maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds, but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use.  If you wear them for hours at a time, the similarly priced Sonys are easier on the ear.  I'm not wild about the way the Maxells fold up, either.  The Sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage.  Another problem with the Maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic.  Often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plastic-on-plastic noise that comes through quite loud.  With a slight re-design, Maxell could have a nice set of headphones.

There were three of us, so I also bought one of the more expensive noise canceling headphones too, the Jabra 820S (see my other reviews). The noise canceling feature on the Jabra was definitely better, but the truth is, for airline comfort, the Maxells were enough for us. I usually have a hard time sleeping on a plane, but this time I put on the headphones with the noise cancellation on, inflated one of those headrests pillows that wrap around your neck and put that on, turned on my Mp3 player connected to the headphones, and listened to Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" repeated over and over at very low volume, passed out, and slept like a baby for hours, so these headphones did the trick for me. I really like how they fold up into a ball very quickly so you can get them out of the way without much hassle and their construction seems quite sturdy. Back home, I stored away the Maxells and use the Jabra with my computer to listen to music, etc.

For the plane, the Maxells are a bargain, but their sound quality is not ""audiophilic"" and the cumbersome inline battery pack make them not a great choice for most home or other day to day activities. They should come with some kind of holster or clip for the inline battery pack so you can attach it to your clothes when you're moving about, otherwise you have to hold the battery pack or let it swing around tugging at the wire. The Jabras and a lot of the other models have detachable cords which is a much better design, but on the plane you're just sitting, so having the line and battery pack cradled in your lap is no big deal. Buy these Maxells for a less expensive headphone for the plane, but for real audio purposes you'll probably want one of the more expensive models, but of course, that depends on how particular you are about sound quality. If that's not a big issue for you, these might be just enough for you at home too. For television watching, I think they'd work fine.",4

The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing.  FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.

The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.

The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.

The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.

I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.

This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.

**EDIT**  In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.  I am listening to the original, reviewed item right now, and I'm glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback RCA brand.",3

I just can't see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carry-on space. I don't see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get: these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on, the sound is even worse. It's flat and lifeless.

I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down super-compactly into a nicely-designed case and even cost a few bucks less.

Even though I read the  reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and  bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet.  I used it for a few months  and was pretty happy with it.  It was comfortable on my head, easy to  adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was  talking to.
Then it broke.
So now I'm about to shell out some more  money for the AT&T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom  with everyone else.",3

The noise canceling feature works pretty well, and the sound quality is reasonable.

If you are picky at all about the linearity of the sound range though, you will be disapointed. When the noise canceling is off, I would say they sound the best, but has a moderate lack of bass, and when the noise canceling is on, they lack trebel. There is no way to get the best of both worlds unless you have a graphic EQ on whatever device you are playing the music with, (ie. a PC with Windows Media Player). If you are using an iPod, the preset EQ modes are insufficient.

The noise canceling is significant though, so if you are traveling in a noisy vehicle a lot, the benefit of noise canceling far exceeds the sound quality issue. In all, they are worth the price. If they were $100, definately not worth it.

One of my co-workers has a pair of Sony noise canceling headphones with a handy button on the side that shuts down the music so you can listen to someone that walks up and starts talking to you. They have MUCH better sound quality, and equivalent noise reduction. However, they are $150...so bottom line: you get what you pay for.",3

I ended up buying a Dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from Best Buy for too much money.  What can I say, I needed it right then.  Something very similar is sold on Amazon for a lot less, but it doesn't look exactly the same (although it probably is).  If it IS the same, then I can tell you that the Dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket material.

I will not rate it on that criteria alone.  While your player COULD be skipping and misbehaving due to dust on the lens, it could be the laser itself is going bad, or some other mechanical failure.

My Experience:
I recently purchased two mp3 players to replace my Sony D-NS707F (not going into details, though I did write a review for that as well).  It was not so much skipping, but inserting random screeches (the only way I know how to describe it) throughout the mp3 CDs that I A) know are good and B) also prior discs without scratches or smudges, would behave the same way.  Not to copy my review of that player, though I do have to say that I see people had it for about 2 months and it started behaving that way for them.  I had it for about 2005 (maybe 2004, but I forgot exactly) to April 2013 with no problem.  It was a victim of HEAVY use too.  I am happy with my two new mp3 players, though I sort of felt bad about the Sony D-NS707... its like an old friend that has lasted me for years and years.

AH HA! .. HERE is where this disc Cleaner comes in.  My initial thought was that they sent a disc without any  on it.  It turns out instead of one strip (like in my prior, well worn disc cleaners) of brushes, this has a few very small grouped sets of brushes, circling an area of the disc.

My first thought about that is oh geez, I got ripped off (granted that looking around at different places, this seemed to be the average price of lens cleaners, so it is not that big of a deal..).  Here is where my rambling of my Sony D-NS707 comes in.  I am not going to say OH WOW, THIS WILL FIX ALL YOUR ISSUES... though I have tested it for a bit (not as long as I should have probably) and NOT ONE SINGLE NOISE OR SKIP in even the most problematic disc (prior to cleaning).

If it did not fix my issue, I can not say what I'd think of this product.  I 100% did not expect it to fix anything (note my first paragraph's comment) 

IF this cleaner,  didn't (I am still testing that cd/mp3 player) fix that Sony, I may give it a 3 or a 4 out of 5 and I will not lower my rating, (I am still not sure if my Sony is 100% again or I just haven't reached the point where it messes up yet) if I find that out.  (I am not sure whats wrong with it, so I am not going to blame this product).  IF IT FIXED my issue, I am shocked at the product.  I never even thought of reviewing a lens cleaner before, though  I do have to say that .. if your player is having issues... ITS WORTH a shot.  Is this any better than one for two or 3 dollars cheaper from another company. I can not say... I did a little bit of homework and read reviews from others, and decided this seemed the best quality-vs-price option.  Others may work as well, though I would not be against (considering what price it may be), buying another product from this company down the road.

I recommend this 100%, but remember it MAY NOT fix a problematic disc player, though it may fix it.  I am still shocked that my old Sony is apparently (for now) working 100% again.  I have a few other disc and DVD players, and will use this (buying another as needed) regularly to keep my products running at their best.

For this price, even if your on the fence for trying this A) for your working disc players or B) maybe trying to to fix one that hasn't been behaving  I'd give it a shot.  Great Value either way.",4

At least, I didn't care until now, when I'd like to upgrade iLife and OS X...  So, I did some research and discovered that the progressive loss of ability I had probably meant that the lens was dirty, and a cleaning disc would be the answer.

I looked at all the options available, and the Allsop Carbon-Edge is one of the few that doesn't say ""not for slot loading drives.""  As long as the disc wasn't going to get stuck in there and rattle around forever, I figured I didn't have much to lose.

Don't want to pull CAT5 cable through walls and ceilings and maybe have to punch a hole or two? Well, consider using your home's electrical wiring to transmit your signals.

 It's an idea that has been around for quite some time, including for using municipal power lines for data transmission.

 While this Belkin unit works, in my particular situation, I don't think it has a high utility value. My WiFi signal reaches everywhere in my unit - and even to some areas outside. My network speeds are acceptable for my needs, but might not be fast enough to satisfy someone else. If I needed additional coverage, I'd add another WiFi access point - or simply use one of the cables I strung before the days of usable WiFi.

 So, what about this unit? It works, though it won't deliver 200Mbps (which Belkin acknowledges). The power brick must be plugged directly into the outlet: no extension cords, no power bars. For most two socket wall outlets, the power adapter is so big that it means the second outlet is rendered unusable.

 Setup on the one port model is easy. Power up and plug the respective units in. That's it.

 The one-port model is extremely limited, though, considering the limitations imposed by the power adapter's appetite for sockets. The three-port model is strongly urged.

 Overall, this gadget works. But I would suggest a careful review of your needs and available alternatives before choosing it.

They are easy to install and set up, and performance is decent.  So, why do I rate them as just ""OK""?  For me, it's mostly due to the speed versus the price (and the speed is specific to my electrical system).  Below are some details that might help you make your decision on buying this.

-Set Up-
Setting them up couldn't have been easier.  Plug one in...plug the other one in...done.  :)  It really is that simple.  I had my connection up and running in minutes.  If you, or whoever you are buying this for, aren't tech savvy then these might be perfect.  They worked throughout my house in various outlets.  I tried them plugged directly into the wall (as the instructions recommend) and into surge protectors, and the performance was the same for me.  So, I don't think that you need to try hard to get it plugged directly into the wall.

-Form Factor-
These are a bit on the large side, but they aren't too bad.  Much larger than my 802.11n wireless adapters, but they fit just fine into wall outlets and don't stand out too bad.

-Speed-
Here's where I liked, but didn't love, these.  In my house, I didn't come close to the theoretical 200 Mbps performance.  It was better than 802.11g, but worse than 802.11n.  I checked speeds both by connecting my PC to my PS3, and by transferring files from my PC to my Mac.  The speeds that I achieved are shown below, and performance in your house will vary at least a bit.
 - 802.11g = ~15 Mbps
 - Belkin VideoLink = ~30-40 Mbps, depending on outlets used
 - 802.11n = ~70 Mbps
So, it's about twice as good as 802.11g, but about half as good as 802.11n.  Due to my streaming desires, the 802.11n is my choice.

-Value-
This, of course, comes down to your goal.  If you just want something, wireless or otherwise, to connect your network without running ethernet cables through the house, then I recommend looking more into 802.11n systems.  For me, I already had a wireless basestation and didn't have to worry about that cost.  If you don't have any wireless capability at all, then these adapters would be less expensive as a system.

So, for me, an 802.11n wireless system was a better overall value due to similar cost and better performance (hence, the knock down from ""like"" to ""OK"").  I'm comfortable with the security in my wireless connection, so that wasn't a decision criteria for me.  Overall, these adapters aren't a bad system, but I think that there are better choices out there for about the same cost.

Router--> Ethernet cable --> Adapter --> Electrical outlet

Electrical outlet --> Adapter --> Ethernet cable --> Internet ready device (game, TV, laptop...)

We've been having some connection issues with two of our older Mac PowerBook laptops that are typically in the farthest corner of the house from the router.  It's funny that a neighbor two houses down and across the street can get a better connection than my husband's laptops.  Rather than try yet another router, when we've tried a lot of very fast and efficient routers, this Belkin Videolink looked like it would do the job.

And it does.  It sets up a perfectly wired connection to any of the devices that need a connection to the internet.

We have been using this one to hook up laptops and one small television for a couple of months without any issue.  The primary flaw to this is that the Ethernet cables are about three feet long, which doesn't allow for very much flexibility on either end of the connection.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AmazonBasics-RJ45-Cat5e-Ethernet-Patch-Cable-14-Feet-4-2-Meters/dp/B001TH7GVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AmazonBasics RJ45 Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable (14 Feet/4.2 Meters)</a>&nbsp;is an inexpensive fix for this problem.

Get AV500 for Video,"My title says it all. These devices works well if all you are doing is web browsing and reading emails.  For video you should (and I did) invest in the AV500 model.  In my use, the AV500 model was twice as fast.

I tested two different ways.

First I used it to provide the network connection to my PS3.  I got about 6 Mbits/s using the PS3's speed test tool in the Network Settings.  With the AV500, I am getting 12.8 Mbits/s almost consistently.  This is great, and actually faster than the speeds I was getting with wireless, which varies often anyway.

I had no issues with home wireless phases, as these units function at a high enough frequency to overcome crossing phases.

In my 2001 townhome, my router is in the back corner of my basement.  The PS3 is one floor above in the living room and I got green lights (optimal speed).  An orange light indicates it is running about half speed.  Running the furnace  and the vacuum did not seem to degrade the signal.

Keep in mind that you will never get the rated speed listed on the box.  That is purely theoretical.

The other way I test was to use these as the network connection to an extra wireless router.  So, basically, I plugged one of these units into my existing router and the other unit into the extra wireless router an the far end of my house.  After some configuration of the extra wireless router (turning off DHCP and routing...effectively making it a switch/access point), these Belkins were providing the necessary network signal to the wireless router. It was good enough for surfing.

Overall, I'd say that these are effective and work.  They are not nearly as fast as advertised in my fairly new home (good electrical wiring).  But, they do their job.  I'd definetly go for the AV500 models.  AV500 is the faster standard and is also the model number.",6

Belkin claims that this is ""Easy Setup - Plug and play installation"" but I didn't find this to be true.

First, keep in mind that each adapter demands one-half of your two-receptacle electric outlet, and it won't permit you to use the second outlet for anything other than a fairly small plug--in other words, two bricks in one receptacle probably won't work. Also, you can't install this in an extension cord or power-strip. In most houses, the builder and electrician have teamed up to grant us exactly ONE receptacle with a total of TWO outlets for all of our AV equipment. So this little box creates a challenge. If you only had a TV, cable box and DVD player, you've already maxed out and have started using power-strips. Not all power-strip plugs will fit after the Belkin box takes over the outlet.

Second, the lights that tell you what it's doing (sort of), are tiny and will likely be hidden by all the equipment, so make sure the adapter is functioning well before you move all of your equipment back into place. I had several false starts where the lights appeared to be indicating a solid signal, when in fact there was no signal at all. Belkin's tiny manual fails to explain the situation I encountered, when the Ethernet LED continuously blinks. I wrote to Belkin and asked for an explanation, and they have been referring this question around for weeks with no clear answer.

Third, I wouldn't touch that little ""secure link"" push-button if I were you. Doing that set me back three days before I figured out how to undo it. And I couldn't think of why I needed security on a wired powerline link anyway.

Belkin makes some good products much of the time. I wish they would document their products better and respond to tech support requests in a more timely fashion.",3

-----
I don't think it could have been any more simple or more idiot-proof to use.  All you do is plug each unit into an outlet (NOT a surge protector or anything like that - it MUST be plugged DIRECTLY into the wall outlet), wait for them to ""find"" each other (10 seconds), plug in your router and plug in your computer and BAM, your computer will get a full hardline internet signal.  No need for wireless.
My friend was so utterly amazed at how well it worked, that he said ""for your review, just write ""Works Awesome!"".  And really, that's all that needs to be said!  You just plug it in, and that's it!
--------
I've never see an electronic device work so well before.  Really there is nothing to it.  You just plug it in.  That's IT.
Here's some more detail:
1) The units have teeny-tiny lights on the front, and one of them represents when each unit sees the other one, but the instructions aren't all that clear as to which light is which.  But, I kinda figured it out - but the lights and the pictures next to each one are just utterly miniscule, and so it's really hard to see what's what on there.  But - like I said - it worked flawlessley, so this is a minor point.
2) The cables included are laughably short.  Under 3' each, if I recall.  We used some longer ones we had lying around.  For a quick test, sure, use the included cables.  But FYI you'll want to pick up some long ethernet cables unless you only want to use that laptop within 3 feet of any outlet!

You plug one adapter in and connect it to your home router and plug the other into an AC outlet near the TV, etc.  The two are then connected as if by Ethernet. The communication between the units is encrypted, but a default password is installed on the devices.  More on that in a moment.

The Belkin F5D4077 has one Ethernet port on each of the two supplied modules.  Belkin offers another model with three ports.  I have not yet been able to determine if an Ethernet switch is supported.

When I first plugged in the adapters, they worked great.  The two adapters found each other instantly and I had excellent connectivity.  I did some preliminary tests and then followed Belkin's recommendation to change the devices' password.  The way you do this is hold down a button on one unit for 10 seconds - this creates a random password and puts it into ""discovery"" mode.  Then you press the corresponding button on the other unit for two seconds and the two discover each other and hook up.  You can add more adapters by pressing the button on an existing unit for two seconds and then doing the same on the new one.

I went through the process and the green ""lock"" LED illuminated steady, indicating successful encryption negotiation.  But I had zero connectivity.  I repeated the process several times and even reset both units to factory defaults (a switch in a pinhole), but to no avail.  I did get the factory reset to work, but in that mode there is no security as any other Belkin powerline adapter can see your traffic.)

Having exhausted what I could do, I called Belkin support.  I was promptly connected to ""Sarah"" in India who, after some initial fumbling, told me that they'd replace the adapters and that I should expect a call from ""second level support"" by the end of the day. I never did receive the return call so I called back two days later, and was simply directed to Belkin's web site to initiate the return process.  I have tried again with Belkin support - the behavior of the LEDs on the adapters don't quite match what the manual says so either the instructions are wrong or I'm missing something...

[Followup - I did exchange the adapters with Belkin, at my expense.  The replacement adapters work ok in that I was able to establish a new random password and get the adapters to talk to each other.  I am not, however, all that confident that one can buy additional adapters and add them to an existing network given the initial issues I had.]

Powerline Ethernet adapters have come a long way since they first appeared, and there is now an industry standard of the same sort that makes WiFi adapters interoperable.  I don't know if the problems I had with the Belkin F5D4077 are just a one-off bad unit (I certainly hope so), or a defective design.",5

But, the difference is so MINOR visually most people won't notice anything less in this RCA than a more expensive machine. I would say that this player is perhaps the best you can get for this price (better than APEX and Oritron). Samsung players in this price range did get good reviews as well from Consumer Report.",1

I really like these headphones.  I also tried the Sony RF950-RK, which is in a comparable price range.
What I liked about Sony:  longer battery life (15 hr instead of 6 hr); there's a stand on which you can hang your headphones; there's an auto on-off feature that saves battery life.
What I didn't like about Sony:  you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit (I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge, like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles); when I tilt my head forward (at my desk, since I use these at work), they slide off.
What I like about Advent:  the sound is slightly better; the battery recharging is easy (plug it in and it recharges); they are more comfortable than the Sonys.
What I didn't like about Advent:  there's no recharging stand; the tuning knob is in a really bad place (where you'd put your hands when you're putting the headphones on).
I didn't really care about the range, because I'm really only using them in the same room.  One thing to be aware of: the Advent instruction manual (which nobody reads) says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port.  The line out has a much stronger signal (unless you turn up the volume on the sound source).  There's also an adjustment knob you're supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level.  Before I did these two things, I got a lot of noise.  After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal, I had almost no noise.
Overall I really love them.  I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble.
[December 2003]
I no longer use these headphones for day to day use.  After about six months, I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out, the increasing amount of hiss, and the random loss of stereo signal.  I'm back to using regular wired headphones, this time spending only $18 on an Aiwa pair that I like.  I still use the Advent wireless headphones for occasional TV viewing (where sound quality is not so important), but I wouldn't recommend them.",5

I wanted to buy it so I could use it for my iphone because the charger cable is so ridiculously short.  It works for this, kinda, but read on for more information.

The cable is mostly unexceptional.  It's grey and has a plastic jacket.  The cable itself seems a bit thin, but then USB is only 4 conductors.  The ends are sorta thick and durable feeling, so I guess that's a plus.  The connector shields were tin with gold pins.  The shield material doesn't matter, though, since that's not even electrically connected to anything.

Now, for this cable to actually work, you'll quite likely need some kind of powered hub that can handle the extra impedance.  My computer's onboard USB could not.  I tried it with an external DVD drive (Though that may have worked if I used the external power supply.) and my iphone.  The DVD drive would just spin up a bit, then die and reset, over and over again.  The drive was never accessible to the operating system.  The iphone just gave an error about how it couldn't charge from that device or something like that.  The iphone did, however, accept it when I plugged it in to the little AC adapter thingy.

I didn't do any extensive testing with it, and it really does sorta work for what I needed it for, but this is just a warning: use a powered hub!",3

We have been using the regular brush before and it was always a mess. I often have pieces of bristles ended up on my barbecues.

My traditional brush is good on retaining the basting sauce, unfortunately it is also good on keeping the marinating sauce deep within the brush itself. So, although it seems that it gets a lot of sauce, it also does not want to let it go when it is time for clean-up. This silicone brush is better than the round brush type of silicone brushes; it has grooves which help retain liquid in it. It is made of three tiers or rows. Looks sturdy and well built. Heat resistant up to 500 deg F. The handle is also made of slip proof silicone rubber. Feels heavy and...heavy duty. But...the handle is much heavier than the brush head, meaning you cannot use a small light bowl and let the baster sit on the edge. It will tip it over. Either you lay it down flat on a surface or use a heavy bowl. Also, it does not have a hook on the side where you can hang it at the side of a pan or a bowl.

I jumped on the high-capacity storage (remember when 100MB was a lot a storage?) bandwagon back in 1996 and for several years afterwards, ZIP disks were my preferred archive choice.  Considering I just bought some&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/new-disks/dp/B00004Z6PR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">new disks</a>&nbsp;in 2014, it should give the reader a hint about the influence that the ZIP format had.

The external parallel port ZIP drive was the first in a series of ZIP format hardware for windows PCs starting with Windows 3.1 - As a matter of fact, I am sure I installed this drive under  Windows 3.11 without any problems.  Operating like a highly modified 3.5 floppy disk, the 100MB Drive will read and write to 100MB disk.  In addition to the hardware, this external drive should come with additional software so that it could be used with most contemporary OSs (from DOS 6.22 and up) with a both a formal installation of drivers and a simple detection application that will allow you to use the drive without having to install any drivers.  In either case, the drivers create the complex interface to get the most of our of your drive, most importantly provide the read/write protection because like most USB drives, a ZIP disk has no physical means to prevent your data from being accessed and changed.

In the years since is it's introduction, ZIP disks have gained a bad rap that I fortunately have never noticed first-hand. Supposedly very fickle hardware, the disk drive can go bad, damage the disk, and now that disk can damage other drives.  I since I started using ZIP disks in 1996 I have only one disk go bad and I was a moderate user of the format - primarily for the daily archiving of photos and documents.  My drive and the oldest disk I have still work as well today as started using them in 1996.

In general, it's a pretty good format and certainly one of the better options if you can remember that crazy time in the 90's with all the competing formats like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/120MB-Superdisk/dp/B00006HSEP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">120MB Superdisk</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iomega-JAZ/dp/B004MTOKVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iomega JAZ</a>, or the old tape drives.  Like other data formats, the actual usable capacity of the disk is less than advertised, so a 100MB disk is actually 95.5MB no matter how you format it.  Of course like many readers, I have long since moved on to multi-gigabyte USB flash drives but since I work with very old computers, the ZIP format is still the best option for computers that do not have USB ports or operating systems so old they cannot recognize USB.",4

Now the solution-of-choice only for older machines (more than 2 years), or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that they'll be able  to connect a ZIP drive to any PC they encounter, this most basic ZIP drive  should be avoided by most purchasers.
Fact is, if you need to be mobile  with your ZIP, you should go the USB route these days.  Every new PC and  Macintosh comes with USB connectivity, and the difference in access speed  is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost.  This parallel port  machine is the very slowest ZIP drive available.  If  you download files of  any size (1M or more) you will notice the difference.
You'll also notice  the difference between this model and an internal model.  Make sure that  you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an  external model.  As has been stated in other reviews, the ZIP-100 has  become something of a standard nowadays, and many machines come with a ZIP  drive pre-installed.
Also, even though the price is attractive, think  carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing.  Most  printers use the parallel port, and although you can hook up both a printer  and this drive to the same port, you can't use both simultaneously.  This  is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the ZIP drive.  It can  be done, but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives.  Also,  forget about accessing the ZIP drive if you've sent a print command.  Your  parallel ZIP drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print.
Having said all this, I absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise  the ZIP-100 format.  It's got the broadest-based installation of any ZIP  format, so chances are you'll be able to port your data more successfully  with a ZIP-100 than any other format.  True, 100mb is starting to look like  small, but it's still an awful lot of room for almost everything but  full-motion, full-sound video.
Still, I have to give this product fewer  stars than it would've deserved two years ago, simply because Iomega has  come out with better stuff in the interim.  For many users, it would be  wiser to buy an internal ZIP-100.  Or, better still, buy an external USB  ZIP-100 for current compatability, and leave the internal bay available for  future installation of a JAZ-2MB.  That way, you'll create a removable  media solution that handles both past and future needs.",4

Moreover it has a fundamental design flaw that I find extremely frustrating: you can only put the palm in one way -- so that it opens in typical book fashion. In other words, the slider on the hard case will only go into the slot on the left edge of the palm. This is caused by two features of the front face: it is slightly deeper, and it has milled areas for the buttons. How hard would it have been to make the case symmetric so you could mount the palm the other way?
Why I would like to mount the palm the other way? Well, the obvious way to mount it is the way the case is designed for: book style. The less obvious but *superior* way for a right-handed person is to have the case mounted in the right edge slot. This makes it much easier to hold the palm with your left hand, and in addition it allows you to operate the palm with your right hand solo by holding the open face of the case against your knee. If you are right-handed and don't believe me, try putting the palm in the hard case slider into the right slot so it opens from the back. (You can install it this way; it just won't close properly because of the flawed design.) Now open it, grab the stylus in your right hand, put the right flap of the case on your knee, and put your hand down on it to hold it. You'll see how much easier it is to operate. Now try holding the palm in your left hand and you'll see that it's easier to operate in this fashion also.
Now don't misunderstand me to be saying the case should be designed for right-handed people. I'm saying it should be designed so that you can mount the palm from either side so that both right- and left-handed people can use it comfortably. The current design is better for southpaws. I guess there's some sort of poetic justice there.",3

Since it's called a hard case, I expected it, well, to be HARD.  But it's not.  It's plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton.  The metal sides will give if you try to bend it.  Also, I think the closing mechanism is terrible.  You have to get the Palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then, it's not a tight seal.  And usually when it's put in this way, the top of the case will hit the contrast button and you'll have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen. It does not snap together, which annoys me.  While the case itself may not stay shut, the Palm *is* securely held in the case, which is one good thing about this case. It has a holder similair to the stylus, so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots.  I prefer this way of attaching the Palm, rather than some other cases which use Velcro.  I'm not going to trust velcro with something that is as expensive as a palm.
I totally don't think it's worth the money, but at the same time, having good protection for your Palm is an absolute necessity, so I actually DO recommend that you get this product.  My Palm has taken several tumbles and it's no worse for the wear.  I've had my Palm and case for about two weeks now, and there's already quite a few scratches on the metal casing.  So it does protect it.  But if you are expecting this case to be really nicely made and substantial, guess again.  It will however offer some protection to your PDA.
I think Palm could and should be making a better product.  Our Palms cost us a bundle and we want to protect them.  It's almost like the people at Palm want our PDA's to break so they can sell us more.  I don't see why there's so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible.  I'd rather see a slightly bulkier, yet streamlined case that not only securely held the Palm, but had about a quarter inch of foam padding on the inside to protect the unit from damage, and then a true metal casing on the outside.  Even with some extra padding and bulk, the case would still be tiny.",2

This case could easily crack under little  pressure.  I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the  plastic composition and flimsiness of the case.  For 40 bucks you think  you'd get something nice and strong, but save your hard-earned money for  some other case.  If you want just something to protect your Palm V in, I'd  strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable  than this plastic case.  Even better, go for the leather case that has a  zipper.  For even more protection, go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors.  Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money,  considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage  it.
The only reason why you should buy this flimsy, overpriced  ""hard case"" is if you have a LOT of money to blow, care more  about looks than functionality, and don't care if your Palm actually gets  damaged.  This case will pop open when you don't expect it, and who knows  what will happen to your Palm's panel.",7

If it has a flaw, it's that its drivers seem too easily  overwritable by other pointing devices you may have on the same system.  Most people usually have only one pointing device, so this may be a  non-issue for you, but I've found it difficult to run a serial and a P/S 2  device, and still retain full functionality for both devices.

Why did I mention that? Because this case has recently undergone a ""refresh"" as they put it, which means they re-designed it. The newer version, which is what I received from Data Vision, has way more pockets and space than the much older original version. I contacted another large supplier and they in fact had the older version, and were charging more money. You will notice that it is selling for much more from all of the other suppliers. The new one is great.

This model, unlike some of the competition is all leather on the outside. Lesser models have leather faces on them, but then they have plastic sides. There is plenty of room for everything in here. I have a 15.4 inch laptop, and I can store the large section of the A/C adapter in the same section. They even have an adjustable dividing flap in that section so it does not touch your laptop. The remaining detachable plug in cord of the adapter goes in the compartmentalized section of the case with all of the other items, like wireless mouse, cable connector for my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vantec-LapCool-4-LPC-420-Foldable-Notebook-Cooler-with-4-Port-Hub-Black/dp/B000FKG84C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vantec LapCool 4 LPC-420 Foldable Notebook Cooler with 4-Port Hub (Black)</a>&nbsp;which sits neatly under the laptop since folded up for transport it only takes up .9 inches of space. (9/10ths of one inch) So this case has ample room for my HP 50G-133US laptop as well as the .9 inch cooler sitting underneath. With the velcro secured tie down strap, nothing moves.

There are more compartments on the other side as well. The pictures illustrating this case are a mish mosh of both series. The one I received from Data Vision, the newer ""refresh"" version as they call it, is the one you see in photo number 1, the featured photo. If you notice the second picture and other pictures are a different case, the older version. You can easily see the difference because the older one has a long pad on the strap, and the new one has an oval, adjustable one. By visiting Targus's website you can see photos of the new one in its completeness. I would upload those photos, but I think it is smart to leave the mix, since that is what some of the suppliers are selling.

This case has a definite luxury about it. They have their top cases going for 4 times as much, but this one really fills the bill nicely; it's executive material without going over the top. Hey for 10 or 15 dollars less than the Data Vision price you can buy an all plastic one.
Overall this case is well designed, and comfortable. Highly recommended.",1

I did test each barrel separately and thought the 16x50 view was big, bright and clear. . .Although it seemed neither side focused real shapely, that may have been from the defect(s) my pair came with.

Currently (3/2014) the listing for these 16x50 Porro-Prism binoculars says Roof Prism for some reason ??

I tested my 16x50's on a sunny day.  Tho they're high power (16) for the objective lens diameter (50), the exit pupil size gave me no trouble. . .It may have been in double vision but it was easy to get the full view, at least on a bright day.

There are complaints in the reviews about the Lever focus mechanism, versus a focus wheel.  The little that I used the binoculars, I didn't have a problem with the lever focus.  In fact, focusing by rocking the lever with a finger on each side was kind of nice.  The lever mechanism seems like a promising idea but apparently whether Bushnell executed it effectively is in question.  And I suppose it's possible the lever mechanism had something to do with the unequal focus between barrels and apparent soft-focus but given my pair's other huge problems, it was impossible to tell.

The reviews complaining of the too-wide interpupillary adjustment are SPOT-ON.  I'm male of average height.  My eyes aren't particularly close together but my binoculars at their narrowest interpupillary distance were barely narrow enough for me.  I've never before had that trouble with binoculars.  These binoculars would be useless for lots and lots of people.

Otherwise the binoculars seemed solid and durable.

My main problem wasn't with the binoculars but with Amazon Warehouse Deals, where I bought them.  There's no reason binoculars this defective should have been relisted and sold to me...It's plain bad business and bad customer service. Anyone considering buying binoculars from Warehouse Deals should do it with eyes wide open for lemons.  Luckily they're pretty easy about returns and letting you try again. A keeper arrives eventually.

Of course I'll return them.  I'm ambivalent about trying another pair of 16x50 Powerviews.  The complaints about the focus lever and interpupillary adjustment had me on the fence to begin with.  Then I get this pair that's so miserably out-of-whack. . .It might be a fluke or it might be the Powerview design ??

If you're looking at Powerviews, consider Bushnell H2O; I have a pair of 8x42 H2O's.  For about the same price the H2O's are waterproof & more solid and come with a wheel focus and better twist-up, rather than fold-up, eyecups.  However, H2O's don't have the attractive selection of high powers and big objectives.",8

They really get you close to the action, and the 3-D effect is terrific.  Detail and sharpness are very good as well.

If you wear glasses, you're better off removing them.  If you leave your glasses on it just doesn't work very well.  On the other hand, you are allowed to adjust each  eyepiece separate if you're like me and don't see 20/20.  However, there is a trick to it because you can only adjust individual focus on the right eyepiece.  So you cover the right eyepiece and focus the binoculars, then cover the left side to fine-tune the focus for your right eye. I found it a bit counter-intuitive, and think it would be better if you could separately adjust the focus on each side.  Even so, once you have it dialed in, there are marks on the frame and the eyepiece that you can use as reference for when it gets borrowed or changed inadvertently.

My biggest issue with these binoculars is that they won't focus in close enough.  The target has to be close to 100' away.  Since they're high-powered binoculars, that's probably ok for most uses.  But I spend a lot of time watching birds 20' from my window.  Now I'm going to have to buy another pair for that purpose.

They're also heavy.  Expect to put them down often to rest.  That's probably normal for binoculars this powerful.  When my wife first used them, she was shocked at how large far-away objects were.",5

The ePhoto SMILE is not an exception.
The fact that you can get a camera with a resolution of 640x480 with this many features  for this cheap is quite amazing. However, before you start reaching for  your credit card, remember a few things:
1) 640x480 is great, but the  compression algorithm (makes the picture smaller in size - this does have  an affect on quality) leaves much to be desired. You don't get really clean  640x480 pics out of here
2) If you are going to be using this camera to  take pics of items to sell on eBay or other auction sites, or just to toss  up on your homepage, this camera does quite nicely.
3) If you are trying  to sell a product and want the photo to look professional, this is not the  camera for you, check out a camera with an LCD display on the back and that  does at LEAST 1024x768.
4) This thing eats batteries. Guess what, so do  all digital cameras. Especially those with an LCD display on the back (this  one doesn't).
5) It comes with everything you need to get started -  camera, software, computer cables, carrying case, etc. You don't have to go  out and buy anything else just to get started.

Pros:
Ergonomic
Precise control
Doesn't need a mouse pad, or even the desk space needed to move a regular mouse around
No moving parts
Lasted me 8 years!
Cons:
Your hand is right on the ball, so any dirt on your hands gets deposited. It is really painless to clean, though, just take out the ball and blowing inside will get most of the work done. It's designed so none of the dirt will actually get inside the components of the mouse.
Fourth mouse button not recognized as a fourth button by games, must be assigned to a key.
Takes a little getting used to, a couple days at the most, like the transition from a straight keyboard to one of those ""natural"" keyboards.

Apart from the dull logo printed on the clear bluecover, the general look was the key factor that made me buy this CD player and hey, it was also very cheap!

 However, after the moment you find out that you have to switch on EPS function key each time you play the music, and,after you realize that the headphone doesn't meet the crisp sound quality that others do, it will be too late to return it.

 I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and the headphone is such a problem and I have been using SONY headphone for a proper Bass sound. Also this blue plastic body of the headphone is very brittle and loose, not fitting yout ears and consequently losing, at least, 1/3 of the volume- wasting more battery power.

 On the other head, if you check your local electronic shops, OK, they will appear a lot duller than this model, but Sony and Panasonic sell basic CD players at about the same price(with the same or better sound). At least their headphone will never trouble you like my GPX one falling apart within a couple of weeks.

 I found out today the power adaptor doesn't work any longer though the player still runs alright with AA batteries.

 Well, after three weeks of trial time and paying that sort of money, I realized that I should have paid a little more to buy a definitely better one than this ""Chinese."" the good lesson, here, you get what you pay for.

If the company had actually used a tad more thought when designing the cabling they would have a winner.  However, even the sound quality on these is not up to par with the set of Cambridge Soundworks/Creative Labs computer speakers I have that cost about the same price.
The sub-woofer seems fine, but the satellites seem to have a much cheaper tinnier sound than the Creative Labs Speakers.  For gaming they sound fine, but music clearly sounds better on the Creative Labs speakers to me.
But where these speakers truly fail the end user is in the wiring.  Unlike the Creative Labs set that is configured more like a standard set of stereo speakers, allowing you to position your satellites anywhere in the room to achieve optimal separation, the Altec Lansing set has very short cables.  The left speaker has to be within four feet of the subwoofer.  Then the right speaker has to be within six feet of the left.  Then to add insult to injury, the five foot wire from the computer to the speaker system has to plug into the left speaker.
Worst of all, they hard-wire everything.  On the Creative labs system, the computer connects to the subwoofer which connects via standard speaker cable to the satellites.  Wonderful and simple design!!  The Altec Lansings have wires of non-standard configuration hard-wired into the left speaker and chincy speaker wire that is hard-wired between the speakers (Maybe if you rip them apart and splice wires you could expand it, but do you want to?).

The new fangled ear buds and on ear design phones serve a purpose and are preferred by many, but not me...I still remember headphones off old being the total ear covering design like these, but much heavier in the those days.  These are exceptionally light and can be worn for hours with little fatigue...They are also very nicely padded and comfortable without any pinching anywhere..Like most headphones, they can be adjusted to your own comfort easily, and, once set they don't slip at all.  The phones have an excellent overall quality to them with an older style curled cord that at first is just fine being very up close to your device, but is pretty tightly wound and not much good beyond 3 or 4 feet.  Just a few days use here has already seen the cord stretch quite a bit, so don't be put off at its being very tight and resistant at first.  It will loosen up.  All together the make of these are excellent, the comfort and lightness exceptional..

Now for the one downside...Unfortunately I was expecting a lot more out of these as to their sound for the price...Many people here are calling them a good value, but at the current $49 price I can't agree with that.  I was actually quite taken back at how these sounded compared to not only what I expected, but also compared to others I have of the same style, price range.  These are not noise cancelling phones, which in my experience provides a superior experience.  But I have other phones in this price range that frankly have it all over these.  The bass is at best acceptable, and the highs are nothing at all brag worthy as to their clarity or definition.  This is all just my opinion of course, and, not one popularly shared among others here.  But it is one that comes with several other headphones compared to it of various brands. Despite all this, I still give these phones a 4 star rating.  Only because my experience, which goes back a long ways, has shown Yamaha to be one of the most reliable brands ever made.  For most things they have their name on, not just headphones.  I actually have a pair of Yamaha phones that are better than 30 years old and still going strong.  These will take a beating and keep on ticking as the saying goes.  They may not be up to par with others I have, (especially the noise cancelling ones), as far as their sound quality, but they aren't terrible either. And, they are some of the best made phones at any price...Even with their mediocre sound, they are still recommended for their quality and reputation.  And you never know, you may love the sound as many others here do...",7

The headset  is a much better solution. The band actually fits OVER a safety helmet, and  the closed-foam-cell rubber pad grips the plastic shell securely. The boom  mic rejects most road noise, and soon becomes forgotten in the course of  routine use. (It quickly comes back to the foreground when I try to sip  from my water bottle!)

They range from old tube-type AM table radios to early transistors to the latest and greatest.  Let me tell you what I think about the Grundig YB400-PE:

Strong points:

1)  Solid-feeling quality.  It doesn't feel cheap when you pick it up.
2)  Good sensitivity across all bands.
3)  Nice, full sound from the internal speaker.
4)  Accessory package includes a good quality soft case, AC adaptor, bud-type earphones, and 23' compact SW antenna
5)  The ability to switch tuning increments to help fine tune in a hard-to-tune station.

Not-so-strong points:

1)  Only 40 presets.  I don't need 200, but it would be nice to be able to separate them into ""folders"" for AM, FM, SW.
2)  Battery life is acceptable, but definitely not exceptional.  I usually plug in the AC adaptor because of this.
3)  I wish it had a rotary tuning and tone (bass/treble) knobs.  Why?  I just like them.
4)  The backlight is very weak -- a poor choice of LED's

I know a lot of people find SSB reception to be important, but I rarely use it.  As often as not, I like to just tune around the SW bands at night and see what I can find.  Sure is interesting to hear the viewpoint that other parts of the world have about the US.

I'm a radio fan, not a radio geek.  I just like to play around with radios that are easy and fun to use and sound good.  If you're like me, I'll bet you'll like this radio.  If you're a geek, you may have more bones to pick with it, but on that I really cannot comment.",3

Cons: The packaging is (injection molding plastic fit/finish and design) is poor and much like a product that costs $20.

In this review I was asked to rate 1-5 stars on this product's ease of use and sound quality - i have no idea why, as this is strictly a visual product.

Anyway - I use this male to female VGA monitor extension cable to extend another 15' VGA cable which connects my laptop to my 46"" LCD TV. I would say I am very discerning when it comes to assessing audio/video quality and still feel the picture is nearly PERFECT. It does what it is supposed to, without any detectable degrading to the image quality or ""noise."" The build feels solid and at the same time, not too rigid. I am very happy with this product.

*UPDATE:
This and the other cable I bought at the same time, 2.5 years ago, both seem to be working well. Neither has seen heavy abuse, so I can't attest to it's road-worthiness, but in my home it still carries a strong, clear signal!",7

When I first started using this keyboard it was on my computer at work.  For about the first 3 or 4 days, I had trouble with the arrow keys, and the 6 keys above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up, page down, and  insert).  The problem is that they are arranged different than any keyboard  that I have used before.  Once I was used to using this keyboard, I had a  difficult time using my keyboard at home.  Shortly thereafter I replaced my  home keyboard with this one.
As far as key placement goes, the important  things to know are:
1.  The placement of the backslash key.  I have seen  this in a couple different places on different keybards.  The Microsoft  Natural Keyboard Elite V2.0 has the backslash key above the enter key and  below the backspace key.  This allows for the larger backspace key.  I feel  that this is very important, since this is something that I have become  very used to.  Over the last 15 years, I have tried keyboards that have the  backslash key next the the backspace key, and I just seem to make mistakes  with that placement.  Microsoft has done this one correctly (in my humble  opinion).
2. The keypad above the arrows (home, end, delete, page up,  page down, and insert) is arranged different that I have ever seen it done  before.  Usually this is a keypad that is 3 keys wide by 2 tall, Microsoft  has changed the layout to 3 tall by 2 wide.  This doesn't seem to perform  any differently than the old way, it is just different (not good or bad,  just different).  This will take a little getting used to, but it works  well once you have adapted.
3.  The arrow keys.  Until this keyboard, I  have always seen the arrangement of 3 arrow keys across the bottom (left,  down, right), with one centered above those 3 (up).  This does it  differently, there are 2 keys in the middle area (left and right) with a  key centered above (up), and below (down).
I seem to be able to type  faster using this keyboard than I have using other keyboards.
I used the  original Microsoft natural keyboard, and it is elevated off the desk much  higher.  The older one had an option to raise the front of the keyboard,  but this one only has the option to rais the back.
The lights for scroll  lock, num lock, and caps lock are located in the center of the keyboard, in  the break between the left and the right hand side of the home row.  This  is good because they are easier to notice than when the lights are in the  keys or next above the number lock.
I use this keyboard on both windows  and unix, and it works great.
I am not someone who has had problems  with my wrists, but I do notice that it is just more comfortable.
If you  spend much time at they keyboard, I would recommend this keyboard.",5

But that doesn't negate this review in the least.  Anyone interested in the fastest multimedia card today should definitely check out the Voodoo3 3500.

You can  also encode MPEG-2 video and edit video and audio files.  The card ships  with an adapter cable that splits into two connectors.  The first is a VGA  connector for your monitor and the second is a pod that contains inputs and  outputs for S-video, composite video, and audio.  The cable then attaches  to the cards's connector.
After running this board for past few days I'm  glad I bought it.  The drivers are more stable than anything NVIDIA can  code and the image quality is quite excellent.  3dfx recommends that you  have a Pentium II 266MHz system as the minimum with an available AGP slot.

This camera is lousy, and isn't worth $90.
The details:
Installation:
GOOD.  Installed on a Win2k Pro SP4.  No problem at all.
COLOR: Terrible.  No matter how you set the controls, use auto or manual, or mess with the settings, the green/red/blue color rendition is always awful.  Color shades are all wrong - either too vivid, too washed out, too green, to intense, etc.
FRAME RATE: Terrible.  There are 3 settings for picture quality vs frame rate.  On ""high"" quality, you get a nice smooth picture with so-so color, and a frame rate of 7 fps (I measured it).  On medium, the picture is very grainy, so you can turn down the sharpness, which helps ""somewhat"" - frame rate is now 15 fps.  On ""low"", the picture is downright awful, with grain, and jagged lines, and the frame rate is still only about 19 fps.
It cannot do 30 fps, nowhere near it, not at 160x120, 176x144, 320x240.  Forget it.
CPU: Good.  Uses about the same as other good webcams I've tried --- about 20% of a PIII 900 MHz to capture 320x240 at 15 fps.
LIGHT SENSITIVITY: Good.  The picture quality does not degrade, and the frame rate doesn't drop in low light, and the picture is plenty bright enough.  Unfortunately, the picture is NEVER good, and the frame rate is never good, so this is of little value.
Go try a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 or an Intel CS430 and you'll see what a good web cam is capable of.",6

(1) Lip synch problems. The audio and video streams will unpredictably go out of synch from time to time, requiring you to stop the dics and restart to get the streams back in synch.
(2) Noticeable video artifacting (jaggies, combing, moire, etc.) on ordinary DVD discs that have scenes with ""difficult"" MPEG encoding.
(3) Poor handling of many discs with extremely subtle scratches. One disc we rented (Talented Mr. Ripley) was so bad that the Sony S530D would not play an entire chapter of the movie. However, the el cheapo DVD player in my dinosaur laptop computer playerd it without incident.
(4) Most of the time, the player spontaneously turns itself ""off"" about ten seconds after you turn it ""on"".  When I turn it ""on"" a second time it stays ""on"" properly.  It doesn't matter if there is a DVD in the tray or not, or if you turn it ""on"" from the front panel or with the remote

The ease of use and its inconspicuousness make it an invaluable addition to the Talk Abouts, but there is room for improvement.  My biggest complaint is that the TA280/289 don't allow for the alert tone (call tones / menu tones / etc.) volumes to be regulated.  This makes for some very uncomfortably loud noise spikes with that earbud only an inch or so from your eardrum.  The TA280/289 DO allow the alert tones to be disabled, but that makes it a little more difficult to operate (especially when you have them tucked away under your outer clothing). My only other complaint was in the design of the PTT/MIC housing.  I would've preferred something a little easier to use with gloves on (the PTT button is 1/2"" from the MIC and pressing it with gloves on covers the MIC....). In closing, the alert tone volume issue is a TA280/289 one, not this units and I'd buy this again if I were to lose this one, but I sure wish they'd improve on it.",2

The case is plastic, and not particularly good plastic at that.  The seams between the front and back halves of the case don't fit together well, leaving an unpleasant sharp edge.  The leather cover is nice, and, unlike the plastic case, gives the radio the feel of an item that apparently once sold for $180, or there abouts.

I bought the radio thinking it would be an excellent travel alarm/radio.  However, in reality it's much larger and heavier than I expected.

The above criticisms all pale into insignificance compared to the reception and sound quality.  Both are extremely poor.  This radio can only lock onto the strongest of stations, and even then there is a fair amount of accompanying 'hiss'.  I don't live in an area with great radio reception; however, my Boston Acoustics Receptor radio has no problem tuning into most stations.  If the Grundig scans the fm band it only finds a grand total of 3 stations.  Short wave is basically worthless on this radio (as is the AM band).

For $40 this radio is not a particularly good buy.  There are much better radios for the same price, or significantly less.  The leather cover adds a bit of uniqueness.  In its absence, this radio would be worth $20, at the very most.

Bottom line - This radio looks really nice in photos, but dissapoints in reality (both in terms of fit and finish, and tuner quality).",3

[Update 06/14/2014]:  When I stopped for a cup of coffee this morning I left the case on when I used the Isis Wallet App to pay for it.  It worked just fine.

[Update 10/27/2014: I left the phone in the case on the lavatory in the rest room and an office cat knocked it off. The phone was protected, which should probably be what I concentrate on, but the plastic inside backing of the case was cracked in two places so it no longer holds the phone securely in place. I will probably try another brand for my new phone case.",5

I've been able to convert VHS tapes into decent MPG, Real, and Microsoft Windows Media files in size 320 x 240, but not without some hassle. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, the software that comes with this product is very buggy and be prepared to spend some time troubleshooting to get it working.
Here's my first experience. I use Windows 2000 on a PIII 550Mhz, with 256 RAM and 20 Gig EIDE harddrive. When Dazzle arrived, I followed the directions and installed the software and put the plug in the USB port and then discovered that this software only works with Windows 98. I visited the Dazzle web site and found out that you have to purchase a program called Movie Star is you want to use it with Windows 2000. I wound up ordering the software for [more $] plus shipping. Once, I received the new disk, I installed it, and once again, it did not detect the unit when I plugged it into the USB port. And again, I visited the Dazzle web site. I discovered that they have posted a patch for the Movie Star software that fixes ""some minor problems."" I downloaded and installed the patch and after rebooting the machine, I was able to get it to detect the unit.
The next step was to get Dazzle to work with my cheap... Mitsubishi VHS player. I was able to get it to work with the S-Video port from my Panasonic DV camcorder, but I couldn't get it to detect the output plugs from the VHS player. Finally after rebooting the machine twice, I got it to work.
Next getting the software to work was another challange. despite having a fast machine with a lot of RAM, I found the Movie Star program to be very unstable. I was able to capture up to 60 minutes of video and save it to the MPEG format, but everytime I tried to edit or export the video as Windows Media or Real, it crashed the machine. I downloaded a copy of Ulead's Video Studio, but couldn't figure out how to import MPEG files. I finally bit the bullet and wound up downloading a free 30-day trial of Adobe Premier. I found Premier to be a very stable and easy to use program. I just wish it didn't cost [so much!]
For my trouble, I found the output from Dazzle to be satisfactory. You would get better results if you spent big money for video capture card that would let you plug an S-Video cable into the back of your PC. Another better alternative would be to use Firewire. (I always use Firewire with my Panasonic DV camcorder and it works great.)
After my experience, I cannot recommend this unit to others. I don't think it's fair that this company charges Windows 2000 users extra $.. for buggy software. And I think they could improve the USB connect so it isn't so difficult to use. I am giving this Unit two stars because it does the job, but only after spending a lot of time and some additional money to make it work.",5

I like I can pull back the cushion and touch the plastic backing to feel the cpu temperature on my phone and air it out if it's hot. It bends in different productive ways. The snap make it feel secured in a purse or bag, and the case seems durable. Snapped shut the phone may endure a few drops and extreme situations as long as you don't bring too many cards as it pushes the case open.

Opening the box you're greeted with the same clean packaging style we're coming to know from Anker and the subtle, faint smell of the leather breathe over from the box when you pick it up. Its cleanly constructed with so exposed seams and everything seems fit right, nothing out of the ordinary here and nothing to mark it down on either.

Design & Feel (4/5):
I don't usually deal with leather cases, let alone wallet cases for my phones - this is my first experience in using one personally. Its been mostly pleasant, the leather feels good and gives a nice buffered protection should I ever drop my phone as well - seeing as there's breathable room between the back, the case, and then the phone. The pockets hold your cards firmly and I haven't experienced any sort of loosening with the pockets, My only wish with the case is that it'd be a bit thinner or integrated with removing the backplate of the Note 3, but that's a minor issue - this will offer more protection should I drop my phone, much more than I can say for any other flip case. Also, a part of me wishes the latch was magnetic versus buttoned, that's extremely minor as well - personal preference perhaps, its much tighter with the button and guarantees it won't flip open in pocket or on drop, but, at the same time it makes using the Note 3 with one hand even harder than originally.

Conclusion (4/5):
Its a great wallet case with solid build quality, there are no imperfections and it keeps your Note 3 completely protected while being premium, inexpensive, and a folio sort of case. Personally, I want to keep using it just for the pockets, at the same time I prefer not to since it makes it less plausible to pull out my phone and just use it. I want something purely to protect my Note 3, like the Slim Armor View case or something to be slim and offer quick access while adding some slick stylish protection, like other flip covers - this is a great hybrid between the two.",2

I returned to Amazon (no charge) and got a replacement speaker. Opps, same thing, the speaker played nicely for 30 seconds and then went dead (the speaker sounded good for the brief time that it played). I emailed Amazon.com and wanted to role the dice and give it a 3rd try. Amazon responded by saying that the problem with the speaker was more widespread than originally thought and they would not be able to send me an additional one. They refunded all my money also gave me a $10 credit in my account for the hassle. I was surprised to see the same speaker still for sale on their site two weeks later especially if there is a manunfacturing defect, the speaker goes dead and they know about the issue. Should I give the speaker another try? I really did like the product if it would only work. I've searched the customer reviews and this problem is NOT isolated to me.  Well, if you order this product save the box and packaging as you might very well be returning it after 30 seconds. It seemed like a solid product but at the low price of $32.00, I'm not surprised it failed to work. Please leave feedback as I would like to order anothrer myself, but the hastle of returning defective products is a pain no matter how easy Amazon tries to make it.  Also, I wanted to mention that it was very generous of Amazon to give me a $10 credit for my troubles with the speaker... Amazon.com is a very reputable company I recommend them strongly and I will continue to buy many prodcuts from them now and in the future.  Best of luck with this one.",4

I expected picture quality from the 310 to be at least as good as my old PAL Sony 8mm.  However, after  2 weeks of using the 310 we had to conclude that it simply provides  inferior picture quality in most lighting situations.  Inferior in both  colour reproduction and in clarity, whatever the technical specs. say. For  example, I have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red  whatever exposure or program setting I used; same with the shop model we  checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store - it didn't  appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased.  We  also compared the 310 picture with the supposedly inferior Panasonic 910  and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter.  Why?  What is Sony playing at?  We were expecting twice the clarity  (""resolution"") and 3 times the colour depth from this Digital 8  camera, as widely advertised.  What are they talking about?  When it comes  down  to it, its about picture quality, no matter what bells and whistles  the machine has.
Boy, was I glad to get my money back!",1

The Maxell 190050 DVD cleaner came quickly.  I opened it up & found no directions written inside the case.  Dust cover paper said instructions on rear; so after some tugging, I got the paper out & looked at its back for directions.  The DVD enclosed had 3 little bumps on the playing surface, which looked like defects in some plastic surface. So I mistakenly picked at them to smooth them out.  But that may have damaged the micro cleaning brushes. They don't look like brushes, but tiny defect bumps on a plastic film surface.  Directions say to replace product when brush (singular) becomes visibly worn. I don't see any brush anywhere.  I thought maybe it was missing until I noticed on the front dust cover it says, ""3 Super fine microfiber brushes."" So I figure those 3 bumps must be brushes, but I haven't got out a microscope to look to see if they in fact look like brushes.

I ran the disc as directed.  The disk played & showed directions on screen and video pictures with a menu of choice: like 1) clean disc 2) check L audio speaker , 23 check R audio speaker , etc. So my DVD player was working to the extent that I could see this menu & heard the classical musical background & watch stuff like clouds floating, plants & insects in a video, while it supposedly was cleaning.  But when I got thru on first run, my DVD player would still not play my video DVDs. But then after running the cleaner about 3X, I could now play my DVDs.  But after running the disc around 20X, it still would not write on the discs, that is, I still could not record onto a DVD.  It could be my fault for not reading the dust cover carefully and having picked at the bumps. But I am next going to try Memorex which advertises 6 brushes, but costs a lot more.

Of course if the cleaning does not result in fixing your DVD player / recorder, that proves nothing, since there may be some other malfunction causing your player/ recorder not to work (for example, you might have a bad capacitor on a circuit board).  Thus I wish I could make this review ""Comments Only,""  but you have to assign stars to post a review.

My main beef is lack of warning on the bumps when you open the case. There should be a piece of paper or warning on disc that says, LEAVE THE 3 BUMPS ON THE DVD ALONE; they are tiny cleaning brushes.

UPDATE:
I bought the Memorex LASER LENS CLEANER FOR DVD ( 32028015 ) after the Maxell did not restore burn/record ability.  The Memorex has more microbrushes that the Maxell.  After ~ 1 minute of cleaning, the Memorex restored the DVD burner/recorder so that I could now copy titles off my hard drive to my dvd drive (Pioneer DVR).",8

My biggest complaint is the RIOPort software.  There is NO SIMPLE WAY to download songs directly to the device from a folder or CD ROM.  Instead, you have to import the songs into a database and then create playlists.  If you move songs from one subdirectory to another, you have to manually edit database entries for every song that you moved--a tedious and time-consuming process.  If you re-add the songs to the database after the move, you get duplicate entries, only one of which is valid.  However, you can't tell which entry is the valid one.
Another gripe--after paying this much money for an audio player, it seems wrong to have to shell out another $9.95 to unlock the software.
In short--great product once you get the songs loaded, but reaching that point is frustrating at times.",3

I wanted one to paly audible files so I was pleasently suprised to receive it. Unfortunately I'm returning it because the device doesn't live up to it's billing.
The main problems: 1) Low volume. Even max'd out the unit  doesn't have enough volume to drown out any background noise when listening  to the unit in a loud environment. ie. coffee house
2) Poor documentation  and software. There's little documentation with the unit to describe the  functions of the scroll wheel etc. you're on your own to figure it  out.
3) Headphones- the very first day I lost one of the foam caps and  had to have it replaced, only to have it fall off again a number of  times.
I called Tech support about the volume problems and they just  responded that the Rio 600 has better volume. It was obvious that they were  unable to talk honestly about the 500 since it is a product that is being  phased out.
Having said all of this I did purchase the Rio 600 and I give  it two thumbs up. The volume rocks and it has more functionality to the  controls and the layout. Since the 600 cost over $100. and has only 32MB of  internal memory it's more expensive but in the long run I think you'll be  happier.",5

(You can jog all day with nary a skip, and with the  included netting belt-clip, it will definitely NOT pull your jogging shorts  down, weighing about the same as a pager.)
Interface with any USB  Macintosh is seamless, and the included software, Casady & Greene's  SoundJam MP, is the finest Mac application in decades.  All you need to  know is how to work the plug, and how to drag and drop, and you'll be  organizing your Rio playlists with no trouble.  If it isn't already,  SoundJam will become your MP3 player of choice, too.
The Rio takes  SmartMedia cards and can reportedly handle any size, including the upcoming  100+ MB cards; mine works perfectly with a 32 MB Sandisk SmartMedia card.  (96 MB is just about perfect for listening to a full 72-minute CD  recording, say of Beethoven's Fifth, at 160 kbps sound quality.)
I also  get great sound out of a phones-to-cassette adapter, which I use to  playback MP3's in my car.  My only complaint is that the included ear-beads  are terrible, both acoustically and for the fact that they just won't stay  in!  Alternative headphones can be used, but drain the power source (1 AA  battery) rather quickly.  A solution might be NiMH high capacity  rechargables.",4

I will never again purchase another Diamond/S3 product, nor will I allow someone to do so w/o hearing me out first.
For starters - the box says that it's firmware is upgradeable to  support higher memory capacity at a later time.  Then after we'd already  bought it - they said they wouldn't upgrade the firmware past 32MB cards.  A huge uproar came about from all the owners since other companies were  supporting the 64MB cards.  Finally they relented.
Then the new Rio's  won't support the memory cards that you buy for this product.  And memory  is the most expensive part.  There won't even be some sort of an expansion  pack - the new Rio's will use a proprietary type of memory which means you  can't use it in your PDA or Camera - and you'll pay a lot of money for it  too.
Then, there product is HIGHLY bugey.  Crashing often, it has huge  battery issues.  For instance - if you're transfering data and the battery  dies then the unit has to be reset at the FACTORY.  And this happens a LOT  because unlike other USB products that are powered off the USB Bus, the Rio  drains batteries like CRAZY when transferring files.  I end up having to  put in a brand new battery every time I transfer files just because I don't  want to deal w/ a Factory Reset.
The USB cable - not sold anywhere so you  can't get a replacement. You HAVE to get 3rd party software to download MP3's  to the Rio because what it comes w/ is Useless.  The CDROM it comes w/ has  3rd party software that you can only use for 30 days, thankfully MusicMatch  and RealJukebox will take care of that.
The Rio500 will not be upgraded  to support some of the new codecs (WMA) which are half the size of MP3's.  The Rio600 comes w/ it - so obviously they're recognizing that this new  Codec is the way to go, but they won't support their older products.

It's also far and away the best bet for Macintosh owners.
As others have noted, the only  downsides are the lack of an AC adapter and the horrible headphones that  come with the unit.  This may be a bit subjective, but the design of the  unit itself is also a bit uninspiring.
The unit is, however, extremely  small, light, and portable.  You won't mind taking it with you in your coat  pocket, although I'm not quite sure if it would be appropriate for jogging  (I wouldn't know where to put it).  Don't be fooled by the packaging which  is overly large and cumbersome, the device inside is smaller than it  appears.
Oh, one last nitpick, battery life is pretty short.  I would  recommend using two sets of good rechargeable AA batteries, otherwise  you'll be buying new batteries every other day!
The Rio is a lot like an  IBM ThinkPad.  It's perhaps not the sexiest device on the market, and it's  a little bit more costly than some other options, but it does everything a  bit better than the competition and will last (making that bit more you  spent up-front more than worthwhile).",5

Terrible Implementation,"I bought a Rio500 and regretted the purchase 5 minutes after opening the package.
To load software from the computer to the Rio500, you use the AudioManager software that comes with your Rio. On 3 of 4 computers I tried the Rio software on, the software failed to properly interact with the Rio,  popping up a dialog saying, ""Either your Rio is busy or it has insufficient  memory. Try turning your Rio off, then on again."" A brain dead message - I  wasn't trying to copy anything to my Rio, so memory isn't an issue here.  Diamond's tech support did find a work-around that worked on 1 of the 3  failing computers, though.
The reason I bought the Rio500 is because  memory is expandable using flash cards. More memory is good. Also, I have  some Compact Flash cards for my digital camera lying around. Unfortunately,  Diamond opted to call their proprietary memory card, a flash card even  though the memory is incompatible with any device using the standard  compact flash card. The only reason I can fathom for the similar name is  duplicity on Diamond's part.
The other reason I bought the Diamond is for  use in the gym. I grow weary of the classic rock at Gold's and want some  Talking Heads, Lords of Acid or maybe Mozart. The carry case packaged with  the player, however, is tedious. The fabric mesh case completely obscures  access to all controls. In fact, while fumbling, I accidentally placed the  Rio into ""loop this track"" mode. How did I do this? There is no loop  button. Several minutes of inspection, between workout sets proved  fruitless. Later, after I got home and read the manual - fold out pamphlet  is more apt - I learned Diamond overloaded the use of the multi-button. Not  only does the multi-button turn, but you press it for selections. If you  have a Sony HandyCam, you know the drill. However, while in the gym, the  Rio's interface had me baffled. I blame Diamond for a bad interface.
A  classic problem in the field of computer science is the knapsack problem.  The knapsack can store only some many units and given a selection of  different-sized units, the problem is to optimize how much you place into  the sack. The limited memory of the Diamond is the knapsack. Your MP3s are  the items you place into the knapsack. Unfortunately, when placing MP3s  onto the memory cards, you have to select which card the MP3 is stored upon  - either the onboard memory or the expansion. The AudioManager does not  optimize for you. Leaving you to figure out how to best use every megabyte  on your Rio. This lack of optimization is exceptionally tedious.
Looking at the  specifications the Diamond Rio500 seems a winner, but after some use and  field testing, I realize terrible mistakes were made. Diamond duped me with  their illegitimate ""flash card,"" the AudioManager isn't fully baked and the  interface to the player isn't straight forward due to one button having  more than 1 function. Give this player a miss and wait for the 3rd  generation MP3 players.",5

I found it  to work intuitively and easly almost from the beginning.  You will also  need to down load the free plug in from MusicMatch to enable downloading to  the Rio device.

Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.
1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.
2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.
3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.
On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.

From an optical perspective and the quality of the images, quite a great camera. Considering the substantial cost, several items were very disappointing and caused me to return it on a  cost vs. benefit aspect:  1) The camera does not come with a recharger and  appropriate NiCad (or better) batteries. Regular alkaline batteries last  about 30 min. for normal use.  2) The connection to the PC requires a  serial port only. Would be a nice option to include USB hookup. My  computer's serial ports are all used for other devices.  3) An 8MB flash  card that holds a mere 16 images in the 'normal' mode. 4) When connected to  the PC, the pictures cannot be easily transferred to software programs that  can sort, package or send the pictures.  A cumbersome copy procedure has to  be utilized to get the pictures on the hard drive; from there they need to  be imported to the software. Even with a 450 Pentium II machine, the  transfer was slow (even at the fasted speed setting for the serial port).  The instructions confirmed that photo software does not recognize the  camera as a device to copy from.  It should work just like a scanner (from  a system's perspective).
I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another $200+ would have to be  invested. (Batteries, charger and larger flash card) The PC hook-up could  be greatly improved and made more user friendly.  Considering the already  high cost this is not yet a good package. I was sorry to return it.",4

At least 4 times a week, I'll try  to record a message only to find a 70+ minute recording of me walking  around with this in my pocket.  All I do is delete that message and I'm  back in business, but it's annoying.",2

These tapes work well, a few notes:

- black on clear are ok, but black on white show up better.  Picking black on white will keep you from having to worry that the dark color of the item you are labeling will hide the type on the label -- for that reason, I favor black on white over black on clear.

- Certain items need a wider label to avoid curling and peeling off -- we found 1"" work best on 18-gallon storage totes -- 1/2"" just doesn't seem to have enough adhesive for the label to last over time.  We use these 1/2"" for labeling my daughter's lunch items etc. for daycare.

It would be great if Amazon Basics had a replacement item that was a better value -- if you do alot of labeling, these Brother products can get expensive.",4

It is easier to read than white on black (the letters don't come out as crisp esp when using small font sizes) and black on clear. Black on Clear requires that the background is light or clear. I used to label an old Power Mac G4 Cube computer and it looked great. Other times I tried it on something that was dark and it was hard to read.

The special backgrounds can add a more professional look that the universal all purpose white on black. Brother labels are expensive but well worth the benefit which is a more organized home or work life. I have two brother printers: a portable and a desktop which is connected to my computer by USB model PT-1950. You get free software from brother's website and you can save your labels.",5
